Appendix : Anarchism and Marxism

   This appendix exists to refute some of the many anti-anarchist
   diatribes produced by Marxists. While we have covered why anarchists
   oppose Marxism in [1]section H, we thought it would be useful to reply
   to Marxist webpages and books whose content is not explicitly covered
   in that section. In this way we hope to indicate that Marxism is a
   flawed theory, flawed even to the extent of not being able to present a
   honest critique of anarchism. This consistent attempt to smear
   anarchism and distort its history and ideas is no co-incidence --
   rather it is required in order to present Marxism as the only viable
   form of socialism and, more importantly, to hide the fact that much of
   the populist Marxist rhetoric was, in fact, said by anarchists first
   and latter stolen by Marxists to hide the authoritarian basis of their
   politics.

   One last point. We are aware that we repeat many of our arguments in
   these appendices. That, unfortunately, is avoidable for two reasons.
   Firstly, Marxists usually repeat the same false assertions against
   anarchism and so we have to answer them each time they appear. Marxists
   seem to subscribe to the point of view that repeating an error often
   enough makes it true. Secondly, we have tried to make each appendix as
   self-contained as possible and that meant repeating certain material
   and arguments to achieve this. We hope the reader understands.

       [7]Reply to errors and distortions in David McNally's pamphlet
       "Socialism from Below"
         [8]Â 1. Introduction
            [9]2. Is anarchism the politics of the "small property owner"?
            [10]3. Does anarchism "glorify values from the past"?
            [11]4. Why are McNally's comments on Proudhon a distortion of
            his ideas?
            [12]5. Why are McNally's comments on Bakunin a distortion of
            his ideas?
            [13]6. Are these "quirks of personality" or "rooted in the
            very nature of anarchist doctrine"?
            [14]7. Are anarchists against democracy?
            [15]8. Are Leninists in favour of democracy?
            [16]9. Why is McNally wrong on the relation of syndicalism to
            anarchism?
            [17]10. Do syndicalists reject working class political action?
            [18]11. Why is McNally's claim that Leninism supports working
            class self-emancipation wrong?
            [19]12. Why is Marxist "class analysis" of anarchism
            contradictory?
            [20]13. If Marxism is "socialism from below," why do
            anarchists reject it?
            [21]14. Why is McNally's use of the term "socialism from
            below" dishonest?
            [22]15. Did Trotsky keep alive Leninism's "democratic
            essence"?Â

     *
       [23]Marxists and Spanish Anarchism
         [24]1. Were the Spanish Anarchists "Primitive Rebels"?

            International?
            [28]5. Why did the CNT not join the Workers' Alliance?

            [31]8. Did the Friends of Durruti "break with" anarchism?
            [32]9. Were the Friends of Durruti influenced by Trotskyists?
            [33]10. What does the Friends of Durruti's programme tell us
            about Trotskyism?
            [34]11. Why is Morrow's comments against the militarisation of
            the Militias ironic?
            [35]12. What is ironic about Morrow's vision of revolution?
            [36]13. Why do anarchists reject the Marxist "workers' state"?
            [37]14. What is wrong with Morrow's "fundamental tenet" of
            anarchism?
            [38]15. Did Spanish Anarchism aim for the creation of
            "collectives" before the revolution?
            [39]16. How does the development of the collectives indicate
            the differences between Bolshevism and anarchism?
            [40]17. Why is Morrow's support for "proletarian methods of
            production" ironic?
            [41]18. Were the federations of collectives an "abandonment"
            of anarchist ideas?
            [42]19. Did the experience of the rural collectives refute
            anarchism?
            [43]20. Does the experience of the Spanish Revolution indicate
            the failure of anarchism or the failure of anarchists?

            Abolition] of the state"?

            "socialism or barbarism" actually undermine his case?

            [75]4. How is the SWP wrong about centralisation?
            [76]5. Why does the SWP's "picket line is 'authoritarian'"
