                        Appendix : Anarchism and Marxism

   This appendix exists to refute some of the many anti-anarchist
   diatribes produced by Marxists. While we have covered why anarchists
   oppose Marxism in [1]section H, we thought it would be useful to reply
   to Marxist webpages and books whose content is not explicitly covered
   in that section. In this way we hope to indicate that Marxism is a
   flawed theory, flawed even to the extent of not being able to present a
   honest critique of anarchism. This consistent attempt to smear
   anarchism and distort its history and ideas is no co-incidence --
   rather it is required in order to present Marxism as the only viable
   form of socialism and, more importantly, to hide the fact that much of
   the populist Marxist rhetoric was, in fact, said by anarchists first
   and latter stolen by Marxists to hide the authoritarian basis of their
   politics.

   One last point. We are aware that we repeat many of our arguments in
   these appendices. That, unfortunately, is avoidable for two reasons.
   Firstly, Marxists usually repeat the same false assertions against
   anarchism and so we have to answer them each time they appear. Marxists
   seem to subscribe to the point of view that repeating an error often
   enough makes it true. Secondly, we have tried to make each appendix as
   self-contained as possible and that meant repeating certain material
   and arguments to achieve this. We hope the reader understands.

     [7]Reply to errors and distortions in David McNally's pamphlet
   "Socialism from Below"

   [8]1. Introduction
       [9]2. Is anarchism the politics of the "small property owner"?
       [10]3. Does anarchism "glorify values from the past"?
       [11]4. Why are McNally's comments on Proudhon a distortion of his
       ideas?
       [12]5. Why are McNally's comments on Bakunin a distortion of his
       ideas?
       [13]6. Are the "quirks of personality" of Proudhon and Bakunin
       listed by McNally actually rooted "in the very nature of anarchist
       doctrine"?
       [14]7. Are anarchists against democracy?
       [15]8. Are Leninists in favour of democracy?
       [16]9. Why is McNally wrong on the relation of syndicalism to
       anarchism?
       [17]10. Do syndicalists reject working class political action?
       [18]11. Why is McNally's claim that Leninism supports working class
       self-emancipation wrong?
       [19]12. Why is Marxist "class analysis" of anarchism contradictory?
       [20]13. If Marxism is "socialism from below," why do anarchists
       reject it?
       [21]14. Why is McNally's use of the term "socialism from below"
       dishonest?
       [22]15. Did Trotsky keep alive Leninism's "democratic essence"?

       Militias ironic?
       [35]12. What is ironic about Morrow's vision of revolution?
       [36]13. Why do anarchists reject the Marxist "workers' state"?
       [37]14. What is wrong with Morrow's "fundamental tenet" of
       anarchism?
       [38]15. Did Spanish Anarchism aim for the creation of "collectives"
       before the revolution?
       [39]16. How does the development of the collectives indicate the
       differences between Bolshevism and anarchism?
       [40]17. Why is Morrow's support for "proletarian methods of
       production" ironic?
       [41]18. Were the federations of collectives an "abandonment" of
       anarchist ideas?
       [42]19. Did the experience of the rural collectives refute
       anarchism?
       [43]20. Does the experience of the Spanish Revolution indicate the
       failure of anarchism or the failure of anarchists?

       or barbarism" actually undermine his case?
       [55]11. Why is Mitchinson wrong to assert anarchists do not believe
       in defending a revolution?
