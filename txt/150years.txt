   This year, 2008, marks the 150^th anniversary of the use of the word
   "libertarian" by anarchists.

   As is well known, anarchists use the terms "libertarian", "libertarian
   socialist" and "libertarian communist" as equivalent to "anarchist"
   and, similarly, "libertarian socialism" or "libertarian communism" as
   an alternative for "anarchism." This is perfectly understandable, as
   the anarchist goal is freedom, liberty, and the ending of all
   hierarchical and authoritarian institutions and social relations.

   Unfortunately, in the United States the term "libertarian" has become,
   since the 1970s, associated with the right-wing, i.e., supporters of
   "free-market" capitalism. That defenders of the hierarchy associated
   with private property seek to associate the term "libertarian" for
   [1]their authoritarian system is both unfortunate and somewhat
   unbelievable to any genuine libertarian. Equally unfortunately, thanks
   to the power of money and the relative small size of the anarchist
   movement in America, this appropriation of the term has become, to a
   large extent, the default meaning there. Somewhat ironically, this
   results in some right-wing "libertarians" complaining that we genuine
   libertarians have "stolen" their name in order to associate our
   socialist ideas with it!

   The facts are somewhat different. As Murray Bookchin noted,
   "libertarian" was "a term created by nineteenth-century European
   anarchists, not by contemporary American right-wing proprietarians."
   [The Ecology of Freedom, p. 57] While we discuss this issue in [2]An
   Anarchist FAQ in a few places (most obviously, [3]section A.1.3) it is
   useful on the 150^th anniversary to discuss the history of anarchist
   use of the word "libertarian" to describe our ideas.

   The first anarchist journal to use the term "libertarian" was La
   Libertaire, Journal du Mouvement Social. Somewhat ironically, given
   recent developments in America, it was published in New York between
   1858 and 1861 by French communist-anarchist Joseph Déjacque. The next
   recorded use of the term was in Europe, when "libertarian communism"
   was used at a French regional anarchist Congress at Le Havre (16-22
   November, 1880). January the following year saw a French manifesto
   issued on "Libertarian or Anarchist Communism." Finally, 1895 saw
   leading anarchists Sébastien Faure and Louise Michel publish La
   Libertaire in France. [Max Nettlau, A Short History of Anarchism, pp.
   75-6, p. 145 and p. 162]

   It should be noted that Nettlau's history was first written in 1932 and
   revised in 1934. George Woodcock, in his history of anarchism, reported
   the same facts as regards Déjacque and Faure [Anarchism: A History of
   libertarian ideas and movements, p. 233] Significantly, Woodcock's
   account was written in 1962 and makes no mention of right-wing use of
   the term "libertarian." More recently, Robert Graham states that
   Déjacque's act made "him the first person to use the word `libertarian'
   as synonymous with `anarchist'" while Faure and Michel were
   "popularising the use of the word `libertarian' as a synonym for
   `anarchist.'" [Robert Graham (Ed.), Anarchism: A Documentary History of
   Libertarian Ideas, p. 60 and p. 231]

   Which means, incidentally, that Louise Michel is linked with anarchists
   both using the term "libertarian" to describe our ideas and with the
   [4]black flag becoming our symbol. Faure subsequently wrote an article
   entitled [5]"Libertarian Communism" in 1903.

   In terms of America, we find Benjamin Tucker (a leading individualist
   anarchist) discussing "libertarian solutions" to land use in February,
   1897. As we discuss in section G.3, the Individualist Anarchists
   attacked capitalist (i.e., right-"libertarian") property rights in land
   as the "land monopoly" and looked forward to a time when "the
   libertarian principle to the tenure of land" was actually applied.
   [Liberty, no. 350, p. 5] The 1920s saw communist-anarchist Bartolomeo
   Vanzetti argue that:

     "After all we are socialists as the social-democrats, the
     socialists, the communists, and the I.W.W. are all Socialists. The
     difference - the fundamental one - between us and all the other is
     that they are authoritarian while we are libertarian; they believe
     in a State or Government of their own; we believe in no State or
     Government." [Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, The Letters of
     Sacco and Vanzetti, p. 274]

   Interestingly, Rudolf Rocker's 1949 book, published in Los Angeles,
   states that individualist anarchist Stephan P. Andrews was "one of the
   most versatile and significant exponents of libertarian socialism."
   [Pioneers of American Freedom, p. 85] It should also be noted that 1909
   saw the translation into English of Kropotkin's history of the French
   Revolution in which he argued that "the principles of anarchism . . .
   had their origin . . . in the deeds of the Great French Revolution" and
   "the libertarians would no doubt so the same today." [The Great French
   Revolution, vol. 1, p. 204 and p. 206]

   The most famous use of "libertarian communism" must be by the world's
   largest anarchist movement, the anarcho-syndicalist CNT in Spain. After
   proclaiming its aim to be "libertarian communism" in 1919, the CNT held
   its national congress of May 1936 in Zaragoza, with 649 delegates
   representing 982 unions with a membership of over 550,000. One of the
   resolutions passed was [6]"The Confederal Conception of Libertarian
   Communism" [Jose Peirats, The CNT in the Spanish Revolution, vol. 1,
   pp. 103-10] This was resolution on libertarian communism was largely
   the work of Isaac Puente, author of the widely reprinted and translated
   [7]pamphlet of the same name published four years previously. That
   year, 1932, also saw the founding of the Federación Ibérica de
   Juventudes Libertarias (Iberian Federation of Anarchist Youth) in
   Madrid by anarchists.

   The term "libertarian" has been used by more people than just
   anarchists, but always to describe socialist ideas close to anarchism.
   For example, in Britain during the 1960s and 1970s [8]Maurice Brinton
   and the group he was a member of (Solidarity) described their politics
   as "libertarian" and their decentralised, self-managed form of
   socialism is hard to distinguish from anarchism. So while "libertarian"
   did become broader than anarchism, it was still used by people on the
   left who aimed for socialism.

   Unsurprisingly, given this well known and well documented use of the
   word "libertarian" by anarchists (and those close to them on the left)
   to describe their ideas, the use of the term by supporters of
   capitalism is deplorable. And it should be resisted. Writing in the
   1980s, Murray Bookchin noted that in the United States the "term
   `libertarian' itself, to be sure, raises a problem, notably, the
   specious identification of an anti-authoritarian ideology with a
   straggling movement for `pure capitalism' and `free trade.' This
   movement never created the word: it appropriated it from the anarchist
   movement of the [nineteenth] century. And it should be recovered by
   those anti-authoritarians . . . who try to speak for dominated people
   as a whole, not for personal egotists who identify freedom with
   entrepreneurship and profit." Thus anarchists in America should
   "restore in practice a tradition that has been denatured by" the
   free-market right. [The Modern Crisis, pp. 154-5]

   As we note in [9]section F.2, anarchists tend to use an alternative
   name for the right-wing "libertarian", namely "Propertarian."
   Interestingly, Ursula Le Guin used the term in her 1974 classic of
   anarchist Science-Fiction, The Dispossessed. One of the anarchist
   characters notes that inhabitants of Anarres (the communist-anarchist
   moon) "want nothing to do with the propertarians" of Urras. Urras is,
   however, a standard capitalist world (with A-Io representing the United
   States and Thu representing the Soviet Union) and not explicitly
   right-"libertarian" in nature. The anarchist protagonist, Shevek, does
   discover some people who describe themselves as "libertarian" but these
   declare themselves close to communist-anarchism (asked whether they are
   anarchists they reply: "Partly. Syndicalists, libertarians . . .
   anti-centralists"). Shevek, needless to say, is unimpressed with claims
   he should visit Thu to see "socialism", replying that he was well aware
   how "real socialism functions." [The Dispossessed, p. 70, p. 245 and p.
   118]

   It should be noted that "archist" and "propertarian" is used pretty
   much interchangeably in The Dispossessed to describe Urras, showing
   clear understand of, and links to, Proudhon's argument in the first
   self-labelled anarchist book that property was both "theft" and
   "despotism." As we noted in [10]section F.1, Proudhon argued that
   "violates equality by the rights of exclusion and increase, and freedom
   by despotism" and has "perfect identity with robbery." [What is
   Property, p. 251] Little wonder French syndicalist Emile Pouget,
   echoing Proudhon, argued that:

     "Property and authority are merely differing manifestations and
     expressions of one and the same 'principle' which boils down to the
     enforcement and enshrinement of the servitude of man. Consequently,
     the only difference between them is one of vantage point: viewed
     from one angle, slavery appears as a property crime, whereas, viewed
     from a different angle, it constitutes an authority crime." [No
     Gods, No Masters, vol. 2, p. 66]

   So, in summary, considered in terms of our political, social and
   economics ideas it is unsurprising that anarchists have been using the
   term "libertarian" for 150 years. Regardless of the attempts by others
   ignorant of both the history of that term and the reality of capitalism
   to appropriate it for their hierarchical and authoritarian ideology, we
   will continue to do so.
