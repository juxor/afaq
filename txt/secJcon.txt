                 [5]J.1.3 Why are anarchists against reformism?
                 [6]J.1.4 What attitude do anarchists take to
       "single-issue" campaigns?
                 [7]J.1.5 Why do anarchists try to generalise social
       struggles?

[8]J.2 What is direct action?

              [9]J.2.1 Why do anarchists favour using direct action to
       change things?
                 [10]J.2.2 Why do anarchists reject voting as a means for
       change?
                 [11]J.2.3 What are the political implications of voting?
                 [12]J.2.4 Surely voting for radical parties will be

       what are its implications?
                 [14]J.2.6 What are the effects of radicals using
       electioneering?
                 [15]J.2.7 Surely we should vote for reformist parties in
       order to expose them?
                 [16]J.2.8 Will abstentionism lead to the right winning

                 [23]J.3.4 Why do many anarchists oppose the "Platform"?
                 [24]J.3.5 Are there other kinds of anarchist federation?
                 [25]J.3.6 What role do these groups play in anarchist
       theory?
                 [26]J.3.7 Doesn't Bakunin's "Invisible Dictatorship"
       prove that anarchists are secret authoritarians?
                 [27]J.3.8 What is anarcho-syndicalism?

                 [34]J.4.5 Why is this "economic structural crisis"
       important to social struggle?
                 [35]J.4.6 What are implications of anti-government and
       anti-big business feelings?
                 [36]J.4.7 What about the communications revolution?

                 [46]J.5.9 How does mutual credit work?
                 [47]J.5.10 Why do anarchists support co-operatives?
                 [48]J.5.11 If workers really want self-management then
       why are there so few co-operatives?
                 [49]J.5.12 If self-management were more efficient then
       surely capitalists would introduce it?
                 [50]J.5.13 What are Modern Schools?

       child-rearing methods?
                   [57]J.6.3 If children have nothing to fear, how can
       they be good?
                   [58]J.6.4 Isn't "libertarian child-rearing" just
       another name for spoiling the child?
                   [59]J.6.5 What is the anarchist position on teenage
       sexual liberation?
                   [60]J.6.6 But isn't this concern with sexual liberation
       just a distraction from revolution?

[61]J.7 What do anarchists mean by social revolution?
