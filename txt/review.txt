The Big Black Book

   At long last An Anarchist Frequently Asked Questions (AFAQ) has moved
   from the Internet onto the printed page - 555 printed pages to be
   precise. In an engaging introduction regular Freedom contributor Iain
   McKay sets out the aims of AFAQ. The purpose of the book, he writes, is
   to present the case for anarchism, `to convince people they should
   become anarchists' and to act as a resource for anarchists. All these
   are laudable but I suspect the main use the book will be put too is as
   a resource for people who already regard themselves as anarchists.
   Indeed it is likely to be the primary source anarchists turn too for
   information about anarchist theory and history. Want to know about the
   role of anarchists in the May-June revolt in France, 1968? Interested
   in the origins of the black, black/red flag and circled A as symbols of
   our movement? Want arguments for why capitalism does not benefit
   working class people? Need to remind yourself of the purpose of the
   state? This is the place to turn.

   The book would also be excellent for the (small but) growing number of
   university courses which include anarchism as part of their programme.
   Interestingly while there are many good anarchists working as academics
   in universities and colleges this book has been produced by activists
   writing and researching in their spare time and contributing
   collectively. An example of anarchism in action in fact. As the book
   points out this is `an anarchist FAQ written by anarchists'. It is
   accessible, not laden with jargon but also built on ten years and more
   of solid research.

   Take, for example, the answer to the question: is profit the reward for
   the productivity of capital (page 236)? The four-page essay that
   follows includes referenced quotes from Prodhon, Bakunin, David
   Ellerman, the economist Joan Robinson, William Lazonick, and early
   English socialist Thomas Hodgskin. The answer to the question, in a
   nutshell, is "the reason why capital gets a "reward" is simply due to
   the current system which gives the capitalist class an advantage which
   allows them to refuse access to their property except under the
   condition that they command the workers to make more than they have to
   pay in wages and keep their capital at the end of production process to
   be used afresh the next". While I suspect that most readers of Freedom
   would have given a similar answer having a resource that we can turn
   too to provide quotes from other anarchists and critics of capitalism
   as well as reminding ourselves (or finding for the first time)
   anarchist arguments is invaluable.

   The book, the first of two volumes, is organised around the following
   main questions: What is Anarchism?; Why do anarchists oppose the
   current system?; What are the myths of capitalist economics?; How does
   statism and capitalism affect society?; What do anarchists think cause
   ecological problems?; and Is `anarcho'-capitalism a type of anarchism?
   Each section is broken down into a series of sub-questions addressing
   specific elements of the main theme. The structure of the book is such
   that it is easy to dip into.

   If there is a single underlying theme to the book it is one born from
   the original web-based AFAQ project, that is the only political theory
   that can legitimately be called `anarchism' is a comprehensively left
   wing ideology rooted in class politics. All other claims to anarchism
   and libertarianism are at best partial and at worse as in the case of
   so-called `anarcho'-capitalism retrograde. Anarchism is a left project
   or it is nothing.

   The book also provides valuable arguments against those on the
   authoritarian left like Lenin who described anarchism once as `an
   infantile disorder'.

   While addressing the big questions that anarchism as a credible
   political theory needs to answer as well as responding to the
   criticisms levelled at anarchism from both the left and right, the book
   also includes an interesting [2]Appendix on the Symbols of Anarchy
   describing the history of the black flag including its use by Nestor
   Makhno's partisans in the Russian Revolution when they managed to keep
   Ukraine free of authoritarian rule for two years. The use of the black
   flag by libertarians, however, dates much further back than that. AFAQs
   points out that "Louise Michel, famous participant in the Paris Commune
   of 1871, was instrumental in popularising the use of the black flag in
   anarchist circles". Unlike the black flag the history of the circled A
   symbol is less clear. While some like Peter Marshall claims that it
   originates from Proudhon's maxim that `Anarchy in Order', this as the
   book points out is unlikely. The first `official' appearances of the
   symbol seem to have been in 1956 when at its foundation in Brussels the
   Alliance Ouvrier Anarchiste adopted the symbol and images of anarchist
   militia in the Spanish Civil War with the image painted on their
   helmets. While the exact origins of the symbol are unknown the fact
   that in most languages the word for anarchism begins with an `A', along
   with the simplicity of the image perhaps explains its universal appeal
   (and not just to anarchists).

   A couple of minor criticisms. Inevitably the size of the book means
   that at £20 it will be out of the reach of some comrades - however the
   Anarchist FAQ website remains a free resource. An index and
   bibliography would have been valuable. However these are only small
   points. Iain and the rest of the collective and AK Press should be
   congratulated for producing this comprehensive resource. The prefix to
   the book is `An' Anarchist FAQ. The collective is too modest. This is
   the place to go to find out about anarchist ides, theory and practice.
   It is accessible and based on sound research. Thoroughly recommended.

Posting comments

    Like most sites we have a major problem with bots trying to post spam
   into the comments section.  While looking for a better solution we are
   reduced to only on turning on the ability to anonymously comment for
   brief periods around the posting of new articles.  But if you are a
   regular visitor you can comment at any time by [12]creating an account
   on the site and [13]logging in before posting. But the Spammers also
   set up accounts so to reduce the workload of deleting those we only
   turn on the ability to create accounts for brief periods which we
   announce on our [14]Twitter & [15]Facebook accounts so follow those to
   hear when we have that turned on.  We do want you to be able to engage
   with us via the comments and we are very sorry for the fact that we
   can't find a better way of dealing with spam.
