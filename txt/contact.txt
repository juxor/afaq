                      An Anarchist FAQ Webpage Contacts

   This web-site is the creation of many anarchists across the globe and
   is a classic example of the power of freedom, equality and mutual aid.

   It is produced by a [1]small collective of people who work on the FAQ
   when we can (mostly in our free time, after work). This means that any
   e-mail sent may take a while to be replied to. We apologise for any
   delay, but we are not a corporate funded think-tank or full-time
   members of a party apparatus. We hope you understand.

   If you want to contact some of those responsible, then send email to
   [2]anarchistfaq@yahoo.co.uk
