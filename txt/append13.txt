Appendix -- Is "anarcho"-capitalism a type of anarchism?

   Â

[1]Introduction

   Â

[2]1 Are "anarcho"-capitalists really anarchists?

    [3]1.1 Why is the failure to renounce hierarchy the Achilles Heel of
       right-wing libertarianism?
       [4]1.2 How libertarian is right-Libertarian theory?
       [5]1.3 Is right-Libertarian theory scientific in nature?
       [6]1.4 Is "anarcho"-capitalism a new form of individualist
       anarchism?

Â

[7]2 What do "anarcho"-capitalists mean by "freedom?"

[8]2.1 What are the implications of defining liberty in terms of (property)
rights?
[9]2.2 How does private property affect freedom?
[10]2.3 Can "anarcho"-capitalist theory justify the state?
[11]2.4 But surely transactions on the market are voluntary?
[12]2.5 But surely circumstances are the result of liberty and so cannot be
objected to?
[13]2.6 Do Libertarian-capitalists support slavery?
[14]2.7 But surely abolishing capitalism would restrict liberty?
[15]2.8 Why should we reject the "anarcho"-capitalist definitions of freedom
and justice?

Â

[16]3 Why do "anarcho"-capitalists generally place little or no value on
"equality"?

    [17]3.1 Why is this disregard for equality important?
       [18]3.2 But what about "anarcho"-capitalist support for charity?

[19]4 What is the right-libertarian position on private property?

    [20]4.1 What is wrong with a "homesteading" theory of property?
       [21]4.2 Why is the "Lockean Proviso" important?
       [22]4.3 How does private property affect individualism?
       [23]4.4 How does private property affect relationships?
       [24]4.5 Does private property co-ordinate without hierarchy?

   Â

[25]5 Will privatising "the commons" increase liberty?

   Â

[26]6 Is "anarcho" capitalism against the state?

   Â
   [27]6.1 What's wrong with this "free market" justice?
       [28]6.2 What are the social consequences of such a system?
       [29]6.3 But surely Market Forces will stop abuse by the rich?
       [30]6.4 Why are these "defence associations" states?
       [31]6.5 What other effects would "free market" justice have?

   Â

[32]7 How does the history of "anarcho"-capitalism show that it is not
anarchist?

   Â
   [33]7.1 Are competing governments anarchism?
       [34]7.2 Is government compatible with anarchism?
       [35]7.3 Can there be a "right-wing" anarchism?

   Â

[36]8 What role did the state take in the creation of capitalism?

   Â
   [37]8.1 What social forces lay behind the rise of capitalism?
       [38]8.2 What was the social context of the statement
       "laissez-faire"?
       [39]8.3 What other forms did state intervention in creating
       capitalism take?
       [40]8.4 Aren't the enclosures a socialist myth?
       [41]8.5 What about the lack of enclosures in the Americas?
       [42]8.6 How did working people view the rise of capitalism?
       [43]8.7 Why is the history of capitalism important?

[44]9 Is Medieval Iceland an example of "anarcho"-capitalism working in
practice?

   Â

[45]10 Would laissez-faire capitalism be stable?

   Â
   [46]10.1 Would privatising banking make capitalism stable?
       [47]10.2 How does the labour market effect capitalism?
       [48]10.3 Was laissez-faire capitalism stable?

   Â

[49]11 What is the myth of "Natural Law"?

   Â
   [50]11.1 Why "Natural Law" in the first place?
       [51]11.2 But "Natural Law" provides protection for individual
       rights from violation by the State. Those against Natural Law
       desire total rule by the state.
       [52]11.3 Why is "Natural Law" authoritarian?
       [53]11.4 Does "Natural Law" actually provides protection for
       individual liberty?
       [54]11.5 But Natural Law was discovered, not invented!
       [55]11.6 Why is the notion of "discovery" contradictory?
