                                Introduction

   Here is a list of all the new additions to the FAQ from (approximately)
   the beginning of February 1997. This should make it far easier for the
   return visitor to find out what has changed since the last visit.

   Also it is worthwhile to explain how the version number of the FAQ
   changes. If we are including a new section (filling an incomplete
   section, for example) or including a new sub-section in an existing
   section (for example, adding A.2.20 to section A.2) then the version
   number is increased by one (from version 2.2 to version 3, for
   example). If we are updating an old section with new information or an
   improved argument, then the current version is increased by 0.1 (for
   example, from version 2.2 to 2.3).

   As far as new anarchist and libertarian links are concerned, we will
   add them when we get enough to make an update worthwhile. These updates
   have no effect on the FAQ version number as we don't want to inflate it
   higher than the content deserves.

   We hope that this makes it clear to visitors!

                           What's New in the FAQ?

                           Version Date What's New
                         10.0 18-MAR-04 [1]Section H
   Reorganisation of section H. Some sections have been moved around (for
   example, section H.5 on the Makhnovist movement is now [2]section H.11
     and section H.8 on vanguardism is now [3]section H.5). In addition,
    sections from [4]section H.6 (what was section H.4) have been added.
   Some changes have been made to other sections. For example the section
     on Kronstadt (now [5]section H.7), the section on various Bolshevik
     Oppositions ([6]section H.10) and the critique of Engels' essay on
    Authority is now a new section ([7]section H.4) instead of being part
                             of [8]section H.1.

   The following subsections of section H.6 are now available:

   [9]Section H.6
   Introduction to section H.6
   [10]Section H.6.3
   Surely the Russian Revolution proves that vanguard parties work?
   [11]Section H.6.4
   Was Lenin's "State and Revolution" applied after October?
   [12]Section H.6.5
   Did the Bolsheviks really aim for Soviet power?
   [13]Section H.6.6
   What happened to the soviets after October?
                       9.10 09-JAN-04 [14]Section H.9
      New section on how Marxist and Leninist ideology helped cause the
       degeneration of the Russian Revolution. Why only rejecting the
       centralised, state capitalist Bolshevik vision can lead to real
                                 socialism.

   [15]Section H.10
   New section on the better know oppositions within Bolshevism: The "Left
   Communists" of 1918, the "Workers' Opposition" of 1920/1 and the "Left
   Opposition" of 1923-7. Explains why they were not real oppositions and
   what that says about the essence of Leninism. Talks about the little
   know "Workers' Group" (a real opposition as it argued for workers
   political and economic freedom) and what its repression by Lenin and
   Trotsky says about the essence of Bolshevism.
                        9.9 26-AUG-03 [16]Section H.7
    New section on why the Russian Revolution failed. Covers most of the
   common Leninist explanations of why Bolshevism became authoritarian and
     shows why they are flawed. Includes replies to such classics as the
              "declassing" of the working class and lots more.
                        9.8 27-JAN-03 [17]Section H.5
                              [18]Section H.5.4

                              [21]Section H.5.8
                             [22]Section H.5.10
       Additions to various sub-sections to section H.5 ("What was the
     Kronstadt Rebellion?"). These additions are from recently published
                          Soviet Archive documents.

   [23]Section B.4
   A slight addition on company towns to the section on How does
   capitalism affect liberty?

   [24]Section H.2.2
   Addition of an Emma Goldman quote to the section on "Do anarchists
   reject "class conflict" as "the motor of change" and "collective
   struggle" as the "means"?". This quote reiterates that Goldman, like
   all social anarchists, placed collective class struggle at the core of
   her politics.

   [25]Section A.5.5
   Slight change to the section on "Anarchists in the Italian Factory
   Occupations" to include a quote by Gramsci on the Communist's
   disgraceful position on the anti-fascist Arditi del Popolo
   organisation.

   [26]Section G
   [27]Section G.2
   [28]Section G.2.1
   [29]Section G.2.2
   A few additions to clarify a few points on the ideas of individualist
   anarchism, its support of "free markets" and why it is anti-capitalist.

                       9.7 27-JUNE-02 [30]Section H.3
   New section on the "myths of Marxism." Covers the contradictions in the
   Marxist and Leninist theories of the state, whether the state is simply
    an instrument of class rule and whether anarchists and Marxists want
     the same thing. In addition, covers whether Marxists seek to place
      power in the hands of workers' organisation and their position on
                     "workers' control." Plus lots more.

   [31]Section H.8
   New section on why anarchists oppose Leninist vanguard parties.
   Discusses their anti-socialist and elitist tendencies and explains why
   they are "bureaucratic centralist" rather than "democratic centralist."
   Plus lots more.
                        9.6 29-MAY-02 [32]Section H.5
    A few additions to the section on the Kronstadt Rebellion, to include
              Fedotoff-White's book The Growth of the Red Army

   [33]Appendix - The Symbols of Anarchy
   A few minor changes to the appendix on anarchist symbols.
                        9.5 5-FEB-02 [34]Section H.6
   New section on the Makhnovist movement. The Makhnovist movement was an
   anarchist influenced peasant partisan army which fought in the Ukraine
     for working class freedom and autonomy against the tyrannts of the
        right and left. The Makhnovists show that there was a viable
       alternative to the authoritarianism of the Bolsheviks and that
       Bolshevik ideology played a key role in the degeneration of the
       revolution. This section summarises the military history of the
   movement, its constructive social ideas and its attempts to apply them.
   In addition it refutes common allegations against the Makhnovists (such
    as they were anti-Semitic, worked with the Whites, were Nationalists,
                            anti-town and so on).

                        9.4 7-DEC-01 [35]Section H.2
         New section on how Marxists have distorted anarchist ideas.

   [36]Section I.3
   [37]Section I.4
   [38]Section I.5
   [39]Section I.8
   [40]Marxists and Spanish Anarchism
   [41]Reply to errors and distortions in the SWP's "Marxism and
   Anarchism"
   [42]Reply to errors and distortions in John Fisher's "Why we must
   further Marxism and not Anarchism"
   Minor updates of these sections and appendices to make the quotes
   Peirats' CNT in the Spanish Revolution and Christies' We, the
   Anarchists! consistent with the newly published book versions.
                        9.3 27-OCT-01 [43]Section H.1
    New section on how anarchists have opposed state socialism (including
   Marxism) from the start. Indicates Stirner's and Proudhon's opposition
    to state socialism and gives a short summary of Bakunin's critique of
    Marxism. Discusses the key differences between anarchism and Marxism.
      Also indicates why Engels' infamous essay "On Authority" does not
                              refute anarchism.
                       9.2 01-SEP-01 [44]Section A.5.4
    Extensive revision and expansion of the section on "Anarchists in the
   Russian Revolution." More details on the Makhnovist movement as well as
     the degeneration of the revolution under the Bolshevik government.

   [45]Section A.5.5
   Expansion of the section on "Anarchists in the Italian Factory
   Occupations."
   Indicates the key role anarchists played in this movement.

   [46]Section A.5.7
   Slight revision to include a reference to the Situationists and their
   influence in the May, 1968 events in Paris.

   [47]Section D.5
   Extensive revision of "What causes imperialism?". Provides an anarchist
   analysis of what causes imperialism, how it has changed over time and
   how "globalisation" is just another, more modern, form of it.

   [48]Did Trotsky keep alive Leninism's "democratic essence"?
   A new section to [49]Reply to errors and distortions in David McNally's
   pamphlet "Socialism from Below". This section discusses Trotsky's
   support for party dictatorship during the 1920s and 1930s, so showing
   the inaccuracy of McNally's account of his ideas and putting in
   question his assertions about Leninism's democratic essence."

   [50]Marxists and Spainish Anarchism
   Slight addition to [51]section 6 on the Asturias uprising and the
   addition of Trotsky's suggestion that the CNT leaders take
   "dictatorship for themselves" to [52]section 20.

                   9.1 27-JUN-01 [53]Anarchism and Marxism
        New reply to another (highly inaccurate) Trotskyist attack on
   anarchism. We show how the "New Youth" article [54]"Why we must further
    Marxism and not Anarchism" is little more than a series of inventions
     and does not present an honest account of anarchist ideas. We also
          indicate the authoritarian nature of Trotskyist politics.
                         9.0 01-MAY-01 [55]Section I
    Massive revision and extension to section I ("What would an anarchist
     society look like?"). New sub-sections, new and improved arguments,
   ideas, facts and quotes. Find out about the kind of society anarchists
                             want and fight for.
                        8.7 17-MAR-01 [56]Section H.5
    New section on the Kronstadt Uprising against the Communists in 1921.
   It presents an indepth discussion and analysis of the rising and places
   it in the context of the revolution. It refutes Leninist claims that it
       was a White conspiracy, counter-revolutionary or expressed the
      exasperation of the peasants. It shows the continuity of the the
     revolutionary sailors and their politics in 1917 with the revolt of
    1921 and discusses what the suppression of the revolt tells us about
                          the politics of Leninism.

   [57]Section H -- Introduction
   Slight change to include a quote by Lenin noting that the
   Council/Anti-Parliamentarian Communists were close to anarchism.

                  8.6 14-DEC-00 [58]The Symbols of Anarchy
   Slight revision on the histories of the Black and Red-and-Black Flags.
    Includes Louise Michels comments on both the Black and Red flags and
   why the Black Flag ("the flag of strikes") may have become an anarchist
      symbol. Also shows that anarchists used the red-and-black flag in
                            Mexico in the 1870s.

   [59]Anarchism and Marxism
   Slight revisions to two parts of this appendix. Now quotes from the
   Paris Commune's "Declaration to the French People" in our discussion of
   [60]Why is Marxist "class analysis" of anarchism contradictory? This
   makes clearer the anarchistic nature of the Commune. In addition, the
   comment by Marx that revolution "from below" was "nonsense" has been
   added to the section on [61]why SWP/ISO use of the expression
   "Socialism from below" is dishonest. Also a discussion of the Bolshevik
   hostility towards workers' councils in the 1905 Russian Revolution as
   another example of the [62]ineffectiveness of the "vanguard" parties
   like the SWP.

                   8.5 27-OCT-00 [63]Anarchism and Marxism
   Slight revisions of each of the existing appendices to fix minor typing
   errors. Plus a reply to the recent British SWP article on [64]"Marxism
      and Anarchism" in which we discuss the errors in the article and
      indicate that the disgraceful behaviour of the SWP in the recent
     "Battle of Prague" shows that the SWP are hypocrites as well as why
      such behaviour flows naturally from their authoritarian politics.
                       8.4 19-JUL-00 [65]Section B.4.5
       Expansion on why capitalism cannot "leave you alone". Includes
     information on self-management schemes and why they management stop
      them and what this implies for capitalism. Plus it discusses the
     ambiguity of the slogan "leave me alone" in a hierarchical society.

   [66]Section J.5.12
   Expansion on why capitalism selects against workers' self-management
   even though it is usually more productive and efficient than wage
   labour. The hierarchical nature of the company ensures that such
   experiments do not grow and expand.

   [67]Section F.1
   Slight expansion of "Are 'anarcho'-capitalists really anarchists?"
   Adds the point we make elsewhere that they cannot be considered as
   anarchists because capitalist property, like the state, is
   hierarchical.

   [68]Anarchism and Marxism
   Two new additions to this appendix. The first one is on [69]Marxists
   and Spanish Anarchism
   in which we discuss various claims made by Marxists (particularly
   Trotskyists) about the history and politics of the Spanish anarchist
   movement. The second is a [70]reply to a Marxist diatribe against the
   various "direct action" and anti-globalisation events and
   organisations, particularly Reclaim the Streets in London. In addition,
   [71]section 12 of the appendix on the pamphlet "Socialism from Below"
   has been expanded to include more details about anarchist involvement
   during the Russian Revolution and their links with the masses as well
   as details of the politics of Parisian workers of the 1860s.
                        8.3 13-APR-00 [72]Section B.2
    Expansion and revision on the section "Why are anarchists against the
   state?". Indicates that the state bureaucracy has its own interests and
    so the state is not only the tool of the economically dominant class.
    Also indicates the role of the state as protector of the system as a
                         whole and how it does this.

   [73]Section J.1
   Revision of the section on "Are Anarchists involved in social
   struggles?"
   .

   [74]Section D.1
   [75]Section D.2
   [76]Section D.11
   Slight expanision of each of these sections.

   [77]Anarchism and Marxism
   Revision to fix various minor typos.

                   8.2 18-MAR-00 [78]Anarchism and Marxism
   New appendix for replies to on-line anti-anarchist webpages and works.
   Currently contains an indepth reply to the SWP/ISO pamphlet "Socialism
   from Below." We expose their "The Myth of Anarchist Libertarianism" to
      be a mish-mash of lies, half-truths and nonsense and indicate why
          Marxism is not Socialism from Below and why anarchism is.

   [79]Section C.1
   Revision and expansion of our critique of marginalism and general
   equilibrium theory.

   [80]Section J.2.10
   Slight expansion on why the claim that anarchism is apolitical because
   it rejects electioneering is false.

   [81]Section J.3.7
   Slight expansion on Bakunin's ideas on the tactics of anarchist groups
   and why Marxist accounts of them are false.

   [82]Section J.7.2
   Slight change to the end of the section on Is social revolution
   possible?
   Stresses that people change themselves when they change the world and
   that libertarian characteristics are generated by struggle and so
   co-operative/libertarian tendencies are a product of struggle, not
   idealised notions with little basis in reality.

   [83]Section E.7
   Slight expansion on why Green Consumerism cannot stop ecological
   destruction. Expands on the use of PR firms, "greenwashing" and how
   apparently "green" firms may not be.

   [84]Section F.1.3
   [85]Section F.2.2
   Slight revision of these sections.

                       8.1 19-JAN-00 [86]Section A.2.9
   Expansion on the section on "What sort of society do anarchists want?"
          Clarifies the important difference between delegates and
    representatives. The former is the basis for eliminating government,
                     the latter is a form of government.

   [87]Section A.5
   Slight expansion to introduction of this sub-section to hight that
   anarchists aim for a revolution from below
   and that our examples of Anarchy in Action are expressions of this.

   [88]Section A.5.1
   Expansion of the section on "The Paris Commune"
   to include more information on its anarchistic elements and to provide
   more anarchist analysis of it.

   [89]Section A.5.2
   Expansion of the section on the "Haymarket Martyrs"
   to include more of the history of the event, details of the "Chicago
   Idea" which inspired them as well as why anarchists still consider it
   important.

   [90]Section J.5
   Slight modification to "What alternative social organisations do
   anarchists create?"

   [91]Appendix 1
   Slight changes to the appendix on "Anarchism and 'Anarcho'-capitalism"

                         8.0 14-DEC-99 [92]Section G
      Revision and expansion of section G which is on the Individualist
    Anarchists. In addition to new arguments in existing sections on why
          they were libertarian socialists and not fore-fathers of
           "anarcho"-capitalism, there are three new sub-sections:
         [93]G.1.1 Why is the social context important in evaluating
                          Individualist Anarchism?
           [94]G.2.1 What about their support of the free market?;
         [95]G.2.2 What about their support of "private property"?;

   [96]Section C.2.6
   [97]Section C.2.7

   and unjustifiable.

   silly anti-anarchist assertions by Marxists.

   [99]Section J.7
   New section on What do anarchists mean by social revolution?
   . Find out what anarchists mean when they talk about social revolution,
   what it would involve and why most anarchists think it is required (and
   also why some anarchists reject it).

                      7.8 11-NOV-99 [100]Section A.1.4
         Slight change to the section on Are anarchists socialists?

   [101]Section A.1.5
   Expansion of the section on Where does anarchism come from?
   . While still stressing that anarchism is a product of working class
   struggle against the modern state and capitalism (and for freedom and
   equality), it also notes that anarchistic tendencies have existed in
   society before anarchism existed as a specific political theory.

   [102]Section A.2.7
   Expansion to the section on Why do anarchists argue for
   self-liberation?
   in order to stress that it is the process of rebellion, of
   self-liberation, that holds the key to a free society.

   [103]Section A.2.9
   Addition of Kropotkin quote to the section on What sort of society do
   anarchists want?

   [104]Section A.2.14

   [105]Section A.2.19

   hold?
   to include how inequality erodes ethical behaviour.

   [106]Section B.7.1
   Inclusion of more information on classes to the section on But do
   classes actually exist?
   . International comparisions show that the US has more poverty and the
   smallest middle class compared to social democratic states in Europe.
   Not surprisingly, as its more free market based.

   Slight expansion of the section on What do anarchists mean by "class
   consciousness"?

   [108]Section C.2
   Slight expansion of the section on Where do profits come from?

   [109]Section D.10
   Expansion of the section on How does capitalism affect technology?
   . In a hierarchical society, technology cannot be truly neutral -- as
   anarchists have been aware of since Proudhon -- and will be used to
   enchance the power and profit of the bosses.

   [110]Section F.5
   Expansion of the section on why privatising everything will not
   increase freedom. Discover why a right-libertarian society implies the
   end of freedom of travel and the end of other civil liberties such as
   freedom of speach.

   [111]Section J.2
   Expansion of the section on What is Direct Action?. Find out why
   anarchists support direct action, why we are against voting and what
   our alternative is to electioneering.

   "Anarchist Theory FAQ." Explains why "anarcho"-capitalism is not
   anarchist and not part of the anarchist tradition.

   Incomplete bibliography for the books we reference in the FAQ. It will

   individualist anarchists, as well as between different kinds of social
   anarchist.

   Occupations

   democracy and consider it as the complement to free association and
   individual freedom.

   [148]Section A.2.13
   Slight expansion on the section explaining why anarchists reject
   "individualism" and "collectivism" as two sides of the same

   Newly completed sub-section. Find out why social struggle is important

      anarchists support it, why we reject electioneering as a means of
                       change and why we do not vote.

   Minor update of section [194]B.3 to include a couple of nice Proudhon
   quotes on how "property is despotism."

   Minor updates of sections [195]C.2 and [196]F.2.1 to make the quotes
   from Proudhon's What is Property consistent in terms of edition. All
   quotes now from B.R. Tucker's translation, Bellamy Library edition,
   London.

   Minor updates to sections [197]I.3, [198]I.3.1, [199]I.3.4 ,
   [200]I.3.5, [201]I.4.4 and [202]I.4.13 in order to make the possible
   nature and workings of an anarchist "economy" clearer.

   Minor update to section [203]I.8.7 on the Aragon rural collectives and
   how they were the product of the radicalisation of the population
   during the 1930s.
                       6.0 26/03/97 [204]Section B.3.4
       New sub-section. Analysis of the claims that private property,
   particularly in land, can be justified in terms of self-ownership. Also
     indicates the authoritarian nature of private property and the way
    Robert Nozick ignores the liberty of the dispossessed in his attempts
        to justify appropriation of land. If land ownership cannot be
           justified, then capitalism is based upon stolen goods.

   [205]Section B.7.1
   This section on classes is slightly expanded to give details of income
   mobility within capitalism. Argues that even high income mobility
   cannot justify a class system and presents evidence that income
   mobility is moderate at best.

   [206]Section F.2.2
   New sub-section. Short discussion on why we should reject the
   right-Libertarian "entitlement theory of justice." The means do not
   justify the ends, and if the ends involve authoritarian social
   relationships, inequalities in liberty, wealth and power, even
   "civilised" slavery, then the theory stinks.

   [207]Appendix
   New appendix on Anarchism and "anarcho"-capitalism. As well as
   including the old section F.10, this appendix contains new work - a
   reply to the claim that [208]the Individualist Anarchists were not part
   of the socialist movement, a discussion on [209]What socialism actually
   stands for, analysis on whether [210]Proudhon and [211]Tucker were
   socialists or capitalists, a reply to claims that
   [212]"anarcho"capitalism is a form of anarchism and a discussion on why
   [213]anarchism cannot be defined using dictionaries.

    5.1 10/03/97 Minor updates to sections [214]C.11 and [215]C.12 on the
         Chilean "economic miracle." Why did it require mass murder,
     dictatorship and state terror to create "free market" capitalism in
                   Chile and what was its actual results?
                        5.0 28/02/97 [216]Section D.5
    A slight update expanding upon the anarchist analysis of imperialism
                     and how it has developed over time.

   [217]Section C.7
   An updated analysis of the capitalist business cycle. Argues that the
   class struggle both outside and inside the workplace has an impact in
   creating the business cycle. Old version ignored social struggle
   outside the workplace and put too much emphasis on technological
   innovation by big business. This has been corrected.

   Sections [218]C.8.1,[219]C.8.2 and [220]C.8.3
   Anarchist analysis of the rise of social Keynesianism and its fall into
   a combination of free markets and Pentagon-style Keynesianism. Even
   reformed capitalist is not immune to the struggle for freedom against
   hierarchy and the objective limits of capitalism.

   [221]Section F.1
   Expanded arguments on why "anarcho"-capitalism is not anarchist.
   Contains an excellent quote by Noam Chomsky on what he considers would
   happen if it was tried in practice. Also contains the new sub-sections
   [222]F.1.2 and [223]F.1.3 on how libertarian right-libertarian theory
   is (not very!) and how most right-Libertarians reject the scientific
   method in favour of dogma, respectively.

   [224]Section G.5
   An updated analysis of the ideas of Individualist Anarchist Benjamin
   Tucker. More quotes from Tucker on the socialistic nature of his ideas
   and his support for labour struggle.

   [225]Section I.7.4
   Expanded analysis on why capitalism does not protect individuality and
   why competition puts out the flame of individuality and rebellion.

   [226]Section J - Introduction
   Introduction to the section on "What do Anarchists do?"
   . Gives a short overview of the anarchist approach to social struggles
   and why its so important for creating an anarchist future. Plus updated
   [227]contents page - what to look forward to in the near future!

       4.1 14/02/97 Minor updates to sections [228]A.1.5, [229]A.2.9,
                         [230]I.5.8 and [231]I.6.1.
                       4.0 10/02/97 [232]Introduction

                               guilty parties.

   What's New?
   This "What's New" page will be a welcome addition to regular visitors
   to the FAQ.

   [233]Section F.2.1
   Do Libertarian-capitalists support slavery? Yes is the answer and find
   out why this indicates that right-libertarians are not libertarians at
   all.

   [234]Section F.9
   Update with new evidence of the nature of Medieval Iceland and why it
   indicates that private property produces statism. More reasons why
   Medieval Iceland demonstrates how "anarcho-"capitalism will not work in
   practice.
                        3.3 06/02/97 [235]Section F.6
    New analysis on how the "anarcho"-capitalist system of private states
    will become a public state. Builds on and extends original argument.
