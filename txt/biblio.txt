Bibliography for FAQ

   This bibliography lists all the books quoted in the FAQ. However,
   details for some of these books is missing. This information will also
   be added to over time. Some books are listed in more than one edition.
   This is due to the process of revising the FAQ for publication and
   using the most recent versions of books quoted. Once the revision is
   complete, the old details will be removed.

   The bibliography is split into four sections: Anthologies of Anarchist
   authors; books by anarchists and other libertarians; books about
   anarchism, anarchists and anarchist history by non-libertarians; and
   books by non-anarchists/libertarians.
