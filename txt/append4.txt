                     Appendix -- The Russian Revolution

   This appendix of the FAQ exists to discuss in depth the Russian
   revolution and the impact that Leninist ideology and practice had on
   its outcome. Given that the only reason why Leninism is taken seriously
   in some parts of the revolutionary movement is the Russian Revolution,
   it is useful to expose what Alexander Berkman called "the Bolshevik
   Myth." This means discussing certain aspects of the revolution and
   indicating exactly how Leninism helped destroy any libertarian
   potential it had. It also means analysing common, modern-day, Leninist
   excuses for the actions of the Bolsheviks to see if they hold water. It
   also means analysing in depth specific events of the revolution (such
   as the Kronstadt uprising of March 1921 and the libertarian influenced
   Makhnovist movement) to see if there was an alternative to Leninism at
   the time. Luckily, the answer is yes.

   As will become clear from this appendix, Bolshevik actions and ideology
   had a decisive impact on the development and degeneration of the
   Revolution. With its centralised, top-down statist political vision,
   its (openly) state capitalist economic vision and its aim for party
   power, Leninism had pushed the revolution in an authoritarian direction
   before the Russian Civil War started (the most common Leninist
   explanation of what went wrong). Leninism, ironically enough, proved
   the anarchist critique of Marxism to be correct. Anarchists are
   confident that in depth analysis of the Russian Revolution will confirm
   the limitations of Bolshevism as a revolutionary movement and point to
   libertarian ideas for anyone who wants to change the world.
