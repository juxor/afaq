                 Appendix : Anarchism and "anarcho"-capitalism

   This appendix exists for one reason, namely to explain why the idea of
   "anarcho"-capitalism is a bogus one. While we have covered this topic
   in [1]section F, we thought that this appendix should be created in
   order to discuss in more detail why anarchists reject both
   "anarcho"-capitalism and its claims to being anarchist.

   This appendix has three parts. The first two sections are our critique
   of Bryan Caplan's "anarcho"-capitalist [2]"Anarchist Theory FAQ."
   Caplan's FAQ is the main on-line attempt to give the oxymoron of
   "anarcho"-capitalism some form of justification and so it is worthwhile
   explaining, using his FAQ as the base, why such an attempt fails. The
   last part of this appendix is the original version of [3]section F,

   As we will prove, Caplan's FAQ fails in its attempt to show that
   "anarcho" capitalism can be considered as part of the anarchist
   movement and in fact his account involves extensive re-writing of
   history. This appendix is in two parts, a reply to Caplan's most recent
   FAQ release (version 5.2) and an older reply to version 4.1.1 (which
   was originally section F.10 of the FAQ). The [4]introduction to the
   reply to version 4.1.1 indicates what most anarchists think of Caplan's
   FAQ and its claims of "objectivity" as so we will not repeat ourselves
   here.

   We decided to replace the original version of section F with an edited
   version simply because the original section was too long in respect to
   the rest of the FAQ. While this FAQ may have started out as a rebuttal
   to "anarcho"-capitalist claims of being anarchist, it no longer is. As
   such, in an anarchist FAQ section F became redundant as
   "anarcho"-capitalism is a fringe ideology even within the USA. If it
   were not for their presence on the web and some academics taking their
   claims to being anarchists at face value, we would only mention them in
   passing.

   We have decided to include this appendix as it is really an addition to
   the main body of the FAQ. Parties interested in why
   "anarcho"-capitalist claims are false can explore this appendix, those
   who are interested in anarchist politics can read the FAQ without
   having to also read too many arguments between anarchists and
   capitalists. We should, perhaps, thank Caplan for allowing us an
   opportunity of explaining the ideas of such people as Proudhon and
   Tucker, allowing us to quote them and so bring their ideas to a wider
   audience and for indicating that anarchism, in all its forms, has
   always opposed capitalism and always will.
