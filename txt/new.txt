                                Introduction

   Here is a list of all the new additions to the FAQ. An list of older
   changes can found [1]here.

   The version number of the FAQ changes as follows. A major change
   results in then the version number is increased by one (from version
   10.2 to version 11, for example). If a minor change is being made then
   the current version is increased by 0.1 (for example, from version 10.2
   to 10.3).

   As far as new anarchist and libertarian links are concerned, we will
   add them when we get enough to make an update worthwhile. These updates
   have no effect on the FAQ version number as we don't want to inflate it
   higher than the content deserves.

   We hope that this makes it clear to visitors!

                      class and generally improving it.

    This revision was made as part of getting the first volume of the FAQ
         ready for publication and so is really part of release 12.0

                                    12.1

                                 27-OCT-2007

                                [29]Section G
    Significant revision, re-organisation and expansion of the section on

       anti-capitalist as other kinds of anarchism. Special thanks to
    individualist anarchist Shawn Wilbur for his comments and feedback on
                               this revision.

    The following revisions were made as part of getting the first volume
   of the FAQ ready for publication and so are really part of release 12.0

       Revision of the section on primitivism to clarify a few issues.

     The addition of a few quotes by leading "anarcho"-capitalist Walter
   Block on slave contracts. Which, in itself, shows how far that ideology
                         is from genuine anarchism.

       This is part of the process of getting the FAQ ready for being
        published by AK Press. Volume one (sections A to F, plus the
    introductions and appendix on the symbols of anarchy) is nearly ready
      for publication. We will announce the exact date later this year.

   introductions and appendix on the symbols of anarchy) is now ready for
             publication. We will announce the exact date soon.
