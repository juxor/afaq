   As discussed in [1]An Anarchist FAQ's appendix on [2]Symbols of
   Anarchy, anarchists at first used the Red Flag as their symbol of
   choice, with the [3]Black Flag slowly replacing it over a period of
   many decades. Both flags, however, had their roots in working class
   struggle and protest, both were anti-capitalist symbols raised by
   working class people in revolt against exploitation and oppression.

   Given that the Black Flag became the preferred anarchist symbol in the
   20th century, it comes as no surprise to see that both Proudhon and
   Bakunin praised the use of the red flag. Bakunin, for example, wrote of
   "the flag of theoretical materialism, the red flag of economic equality
   and social justice, is raised by the practical idealism of the
   oppressed and famishing masses, tending to realise the greatest liberty
   and the human right of each in the fraternity of all men on the earth."
   [God and the State, p. 47] Proudhon a few weeks after building
   barricades in Paris, as historian Jack Hayward notes, "predicted in
   March 1848 the internationalism of the Red Flag" when he wrote: "Keep
   if you wish the tricolore, symbol of our nationality. But remember that
   the red flag represents the final revolution . . . The red flag is the
   federal standard of humanity!" [quoted by Hayward, After the French
   Revolution, p. 246]

   Originally, as Hayward reports, the Red Flag was flown from the Paris
   town hall to signal the proclamation of martial law to deal with food
   riots in 1789 and in July 1791 it was used at the massacre of
   anti-royalist demonstrators. In 1792, the republican revolutionaries
   turned it into a symbol of defiance by inscribing on red flags:
   'Martial law of the sovereign people against the rebellion of the
   executive power'" [Op. Cit., p. 245] After that, use of the Red Flag
   declined:

     "the Red Flag went into eclipse. The tricolore carried all before it
     for the rest of the Revolution and under Napoleon, being readopted
     at the 1830 Revolution as the emblem of the July Monarchy. The Left
     sought an alternative and at first it was the Black Flag symbolising
     a fight to the death that appeared in the 1831 Lyons riots, with its
     slogan: 'Work or Death.'" [Op. Cit., p. 245]

   So the Black Flag was a recognised symbol of the Left, so it was
   unsurprising that when the Red Flag became too associated with Marxist
   social democracy in France, the likes of Louise Michel urged anarchists
   to raise the Black Flag.

   Why did the Red Flag become the symbol of choice for the socialist
   movement, Proudhon and Bakunin included? For this, we need to look at
   the 1848 Revolution in France and, in particular, the activities of
   that perennial state-communist revolutionary, Louis Auguste Blanqui. It
   was in February 1848 that the Red Flag "appeared during the
   insurrection for the first time as a workers' banner on a large scale,
   alongside the tricolore. It symbolised their wish for break with the
   Orleanist past." Blanqui's first symbolic act of that revolt was to
   issue a manifesto "deploring the decision to retain the tricolore as
   the national flag instead of replacing it with the Red Flag." The 25th
   of February saw a demonstration of armed citizens carrying red flags.
   [Hayward, Op. Cit., p. 245]

   As with the use of the Black Flag by anarchists, the use of the Red
   Flag by socialists of all tendencies spread from France. In Britain,
   the Red Flag was adopted as a Chartist symbol on 31st of December,
   1849. On 10th November 1850 European Socialists in exile in London
   adopted it in place of their national flags, "a prelude to it becoming
   the emblem of the First International in 1866." [Op. Cit., p. 246] Its
   adoption by the International Workers Association should come as no
   surprise given the key role the French followers of Proudhon played in
   setting it up. [George Woodcock, Anarchism, pp. 198-9]

   It comes, therefore, as no surprise that the newspapers of the time
   denounced "the Red Flag of anarchy", given that anarchists (like others
   in the revolutionary workers movement) raised it in their struggles and
   revolts. Both Proudhon and Bakunin associated themselves with that
   symbol, just as they both proclaimed themselves socialists. However,
   after their deaths state socialism came to dominate most labour
   movements in the world and the Red Flag became associated with Marxian
   social democracy and anarchists sought other symbols. With [4]Communard
   and indefatigable revolutionary [5]Louise Michel taking the initiative,
   that other flag of French working class revolt, the Black Flag, was
   taken up as a replacement. Use of the Black Flag continues to this
   day...

Posting comments

    Like most sites we have a major problem with bots trying to post spam
   into the comments section.  While looking for a better solution we are
   reduced to only on turning on the ability to anonymously comment for
   brief periods around the posting of new articles.  But if you are a
   regular visitor you can comment at any time by [14]creating an account
   on the site and [15]logging in before posting. But the Spammers also
   set up accounts so to reduce the workload of deleting those we only
   turn on the ability to create accounts for brief periods which we
   announce on our [16]Twitter & [17]Facebook accounts so follow those to
   hear when we have that turned on.  We do want you to be able to engage
   with us via the comments and we are very sorry for the fact that we
   can't find a better way of dealing with spam.
