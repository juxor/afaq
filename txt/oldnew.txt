                                Introduction

   Here is a list of all the new additions to the FAQ. An list of older
   changes can found [1]here.

   The version number of the FAQ changes as follows. A major change
   results in then the version number is increased by one (from version
   10.2 to version 11, for example). If a minor change is being made then
   the current version is increased by 0.1 (for example, from version 10.2
   to 10.3).

   As far as new anarchist and libertarian links are concerned, we will
   add them when we get enough to make an update worthwhile. These updates
   have no effect on the FAQ version number as we don't want to inflate it
   higher than the content deserves.

   We hope that this makes it clear to visitors!

                               [3]Section C.12

                              [6]Section D.1.5

                               [7]Section D.11

                                [16]Section B
      Slight changes to section B, fixing typos and making a few slight
              additions here and there (mostly to section B.1).

                                [17]Section C
      Slight changes to the introduction, C.1 and C.2, fixing typos and

                                    11.7

                                 19-JUL-2006

                 [19]Tenth Anniversary of An Anarchist FAQ!

                                [20]Section C
                      Revised introduction to Section C

                               [21]Section C.1
     Totally revised and expanded revision of section C.1, now entitled
    "What is wrong with Economics?". Explains why mainstream economics is
   not a science and not value free as well as how it presents a radically
                        false picture of capitalism.

                               [22]Section C.2
    Totally revised and expanded revision of section C.2, now entitled "
    Why is capitalism exploitative?". Explains why anarchists, like other
   socialists, think capitalism is exploitative. It also critiques many of
   the standard mainstream economics defences of profit, interest and rent
    (such as marginal productivity theory, waiting, risk and innovation).
                              [23]Section C.9.1
    Addition to the section on "Would cutting wages reduce unemployment?"
   to note that there is no theoretical or empirical reason to support the
      standard economic assertion of an upward sloping supply curve for
     labour and so its arguments on what causes unemployment (i.e. wages
                              being too high).

                                    11.6

                                 13-MAY-2006

                                [24]Section F
   New, smaller, section on "anarcho"-capitalism is not anarchism. This is
   an edited version of the original section F (which has been put into an
                                 appendix).

        [25]Appendix -- Is "anarcho"-capitalism a type of anarchism?
      The old section F (with some very slight changes here and there).

       This is part of the process of getting the FAQ ready for being
   published by AK Press. Not only does this change mean that the AK Press
    proof-readers have less to look at, it puts "anarcho"-capitalism more
   into context. If it were not for some academics taking their claims at
             face value, this section would not even be needed.

                                    11.5

                                 22-APR-2006

                               [26]Section F.7
    New section on the history of "anarcho"-capitalism and how it always
    (rightly) rejected the term "anarchist." Discusses how a "right-wing
        anarchism" is impossible (it would just be rule by the rich).

                              [27]Section F.11
                   The old section F.7 (on "Natural Law")

                               [28]Section F.9
   Yet more evidence on why Viking Iceland was not an "anarcho"-capitalist
   system. As far as it was anarchic, it was not capitalist. As it became
                      capitalistic, it became statist.

                               [29]Section F.1
    A rewrite of the first section to summarise the rest of the section F
   to show how "anarcho"-capitalism's own definition of the state refutes
                         its claim to be anarchist.

                              [30]Section F.1.4
     Some of what was originally in section F.1, plus some new bits and
       pieces on how individualist anarchism is not really related to
                            "anarcho"-capitalism.

                              [31]Section F.2.6
   A few changes on right "libertarian" support for voluntary slavery and
                     how its exposes its contradictions.

                        [32]Section F --Introduction
               Slight change to the introduction to Section F

                              [33]Section F.1.3
        A few additions on the non-scientific nature of most kinds of
    right-wing libertarianism and how it produces authoritarian politics.

       This is part of the process of getting the FAQ ready for being
   published by AK Press. The next stage will be moving section F into an
   appendix and replacing it with a much more edited version. This because
   "anarcho"-capitalism is not important and it takes up too much space in
                           an FAQ about anarchism.

                                    11.4

                                 15-FEB-2006

                   [34]Appendix -- The symbols of Anarchy
     Revision of the appendix on the symbols of anarchy to fix typos and
    improve it. This is part of the process of getting the FAQ ready for
                        being published by AK Press.

                                    11.3

                                 31-JAN-2006

                                [35]Section A
       Minor changes to section A to change the references for Murray
       Bookchin's "The Ecology of Freedom" to the most recent edition,
   including new works by Voltairine de Cleyre and Lucy Parsons, and make
    a few minor additions here and there (mostly to sections A.2, A.2.1,
          A.2.18, A.3, A.3.1, A.3.5, A.3.8, A.4, A.5.2, and A.5.5).

                                    11.2

                                 19-JUL-2005

                                [36]Section B
      Major revision of section B to fix typos and improve some of the
     sections. This is part of the process of getting the FAQ ready for
                        being published by AK Press.

                              [37]Section B.1.6
              New sub-section on how hierarchy can be overcome.

                              [38]Section B.2.6
     New sub-section on how the state can be an independent power within
                                   society

                              [39]Section B.3.5
    New sub-section on why state owned property is basically the same as
                              private property.

                              [40]Section B.7.2
    New sub-section on social mobility in capitalism and why it does not
    make class or inequality irrelevant. The rest of section B.7 has been
              reorganised to take the new section into account.

                                [41]Section A
       Slight changes to section A to change the references for Murray
    Bookchin's "Post-Scarcity Anarchism" and Martha A. Ackelsberg's "Free
       Women of Spain" to the most recent edition and make a few minor
              additions here and there (mostly to section A.4).

                                    11.1

                                 10-JAN-2005

                                [42]Section A
    Slight changes to section A to fix a few typos, change the references
    for Rudolf Rocker's "Anarcho-Syndicalism" to the most recent edition
   and make a few minor additions here and there (mostly to section A.1).

                                    11.0

                                 03-OCT-2004

                                [43]Section A
    Revision of section A to fix typos and improve some of the sections.
       This is part of the process of getting the FAQ ready for being
                           published by AK Press.

                             [44]Section A.2.20
       New section on why most anarchists are atheists. Discusses the
   anti-anarchist nature of religion as well as its social role in aiding
       the powerful and making the oppressed accept their lot in life.

                              [45]Section A.3.9
   New section on "anarcho-primitivism," explaining what it stands for and

                              [49]Section A.4.4
   New sub-sections on thinkers who are close to anarchism but are not, in
     fact, anarchists. They include liberals, socialists and marxists as
                  well as others not so easily categorised.

                             [50]Section H.3.15
      New section on why the Leninist argument that "objective factors"
