                 News-groups which are explicitly anarchist.

     Like the rest of the usenet, the newsgroups for anarchism is filled
    with junk mail, pro-capitalist libertarians (some of them claiming to
   be anarchists), off the subject comments and personal attacks. But what
   else can you expect from a completely uncensored news-channel? You also
   find interesting debates and announcements about events, and newsgroups
   have one advantage over mailing-lists: You only read the posts you pick
    out yourselves, while the contents of mailing lists keep dumping down
                              in your mailbox.
