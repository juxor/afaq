Anarchist Newsgroups

   News-groups which are explicitly anarchist.

   Like the rest of the usenet, the newsgroups for anarchism is filled
   with junk mail, pro-capitalist libertarians (some of them claiming to

   else can you expect from a completely uncensored news-channel? You also
   find interesting debates and announcements about events, and newsgroups
   have one advantage over mailing-lists: You only read the
   posts you pick out yourselves, while the contents of mailing lists keep
   dumping down in your mailbox.
