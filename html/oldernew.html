<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p></center>
Here is a list of all the new additions to the FAQ from (approximately)
the beginning of February 1997. This should make it far easier for the 
return visitor to find out what has changed since the last visit.
<p>
Also it is worthwhile to explain how the version number of the FAQ
changes. If we are including a new section (filling an incomplete 
section, for example) or including a new sub-section in an existing 
section (for example, adding A.2.20 to section A.2) then the version
number is increased by one (from version 2.2 to version 3, for example).
If we are updating an old section with new information or an improved
argument, then the current version is increased by 0.1 (for example,
from version 2.2 to 2.3).
<p>
As far as new anarchist and libertarian links are concerned, we will add them
when we get enough to make an update worthwhile. These updates have no 
effect on the FAQ version number as we don't want to inflate it higher than 
the content deserves.
<p>
We hope that this makes it clear to visitors!

<a href="secHcon.html">Section H</a>
<br>Reorganisation of section H. Some sections
have been moved around (for example, section H.5
on the Makhnovist movement is now 
<a href="secH11.html">section H.11</a> and 
section H.8 on vanguardism is now 
<a href="secH5.html">section H.5</a>). In addition, 
sections from <a href="secH6.html">section H.6</a> 
(what was section H.4) have been added.
Some changes have been made to other sections. For
example the section on Kronstadt (now 
<a href="secH7.html">section H.7</a>), 
the section on various Bolshevik Oppositions 
(<a href="secH10.html">section H.10</a>) and 
the critique of Engels' essay

<br>New section on the better know oppositions within
Bolshevism: The "Left Communists" of 1918, the "Workers'
Opposition" of 1920/1 and the "Left Opposition" of 1923-7.
Explains why they were not real oppositions and what that
says about the essence of Leninism. Talks about the little
know "Workers' Group" (a real opposition as it argued for
workers political and economic freedom) and what its 
repression by Lenin and Trotsky says about the essence
of Bolshevism.

<TD>9.7</TD><TD>27-JUNE-02</TD>
<TD><a href="secH3.html">Section H.3</a>
<br>New section on the "myths of Marxism." Covers
the contradictions in the Marxist and Leninist theories
of the state, whether the state is simply an instrument
of class rule and whether anarchists and Marxists want 
the same thing. In addition, covers whether Marxists seek
to place power in the hands of workers' organisation and
their position on "workers' control." Plus lots more.

<a href="secH8.html">Section H.8</a>

<a href="secH6.html">Section H.6</a>
<br>New section on the Makhnovist movement. The
Makhnovist movement was an anarchist influenced 
peasant partisan army which fought in the Ukraine
for working class freedom and autonomy against the
tyrannts of the right and left. The Makhnovists 
show that there was a viable alternative to the
authoritarianism of the Bolsheviks and that Bolshevik
ideology played a key role in the degeneration of the
revolution. This section summarises the military 
history of the movement, its constructive social ideas
and its attempts to apply them. In addition it refutes 
common allegations against the Makhnovists (such as they 
were anti-Semitic, worked with the Whites, were Nationalists, 
anti-town and so on).

Indicates Stirner's and Proudhon's opposition to

Situationists and their influence in the May,
1968 events in Paris.

<a href="secD5.html">Section D.5</a>
<br>Extensive revision of <i><b>"What causes imperialism?"</b></i>.
Provides an anarchist analysis of what causes imperialism,
how it has changed over time and how "globalisation" is
just another, more modern, form of it.
<p>
<a href="append31.html#app15">Did Trotsky keep alive Leninism's
 <i>"democratic essence"</i>?</a>
<br>A new section to <a href="append31.html">Reply to errors and distortions 
in David McNally's pamphlet <i>"Socialism from Below"</i>.</a> This
section discusses Trotsky's support for party dictatorship
during the 1920s and 1930s, so showing the inaccuracy of 
McNally's account of his ideas <b>and</b> putting in
question his assertions about Leninism's <i>democratic essence."</i>

<a href="append3.html">Anarchism and Marxism</a>
<br>New reply to another (highly inaccurate) 
Trotskyist attack on anarchism. We show how
the "New Youth" article <a href="append3.html#app35">
"Why we must further Marxism and not Anarchism"</a>
is little more than a series of inventions and
does not present an honest account of anarchist
ideas. We also indicate the authoritarian nature
of Trotskyist politics.

<TD>
<a href="secH5.html">Section H.5</a>
<br>New section on the Kronstadt Uprising against
the Communists in 1921. It presents an indepth
discussion and analysis of the rising and places
it in the context of the revolution. It refutes
Leninist claims that it was a White conspiracy,
counter-revolutionary or expressed the exasperation
of the peasants. It shows the continuity of the
the revolutionary sailors and their politics in 1917
with the revolt of 1921 and discusses what the
suppression of the revolt tells us about the
politics of Leninism.
<p>
<a href="secHint.html">Section H -- Introduction</a>
<br>Slight change to include a quote by Lenin 
noting that the Council/Anti-Parliamentarian Communists 
were close to anarchism.

<a href="append2.html">The Symbols of Anarchy</a>
<br>Slight revision on the histories of the Black
and Red-and-Black Flags. Includes Louise Michels
comments on both the Black and Red flags and why
the Black Flag ("the flag of strikes") may have
become an anarchist symbol. Also shows that 
anarchists used the red-and-black flag in
Mexico in the 1870s.
<p>
<a href="append3.html">Anarchism and Marxism</a>
<br>Slight revisions to two parts of this appendix.
Now quotes from the Paris Commune's "Declaration to
the French People" in our discussion of <i>
<a href="append31.html#app12">
Why is Marxist "class analysis" of anarchism contradictory?</a>
</i> This makes clearer the anarchistic nature of
the Commune. In addition, the comment by Marx that
revolution <i>"from below"</i> was <i>"nonsense"</i> 
has been added to the section on 
<a href="append31.html#app14">why SWP/ISO use of the
expression <i>"Socialism from below"</i> is dishonest</a>. 
Also a discussion of the Bolshevik
hostility towards workers' councils in the 1905
Russian Revolution as another example of the

<TD>
<a href="append3.html">Anarchism and Marxism</a>
<br>Slight revisions of each of the existing appendices
to fix minor typing errors. Plus a reply to the
recent British SWP article on 
<a href="append3.html#app34">"Marxism and Anarchism"</a>
in which we discuss the errors in the article and
indicate that the disgraceful behaviour of the SWP
in the recent "Battle of Prague" shows that the SWP
are hypocrites as well as why such behaviour flows
naturally from their authoritarian politics.

<TD>
<a href="secB4.html#secb45">Section B.4.5</a>
<br>Expansion on why capitalism cannot "leave you alone".
Includes information on self-management schemes and why
they management stop them and what this implies for
capitalism. Plus it discusses the ambiguity of the 
slogan "leave me alone" in a hierarchical society.
<p>
<a href="secJ5.html#secj512">Section J.5.12</a>
<br>Expansion on why capitalism selects against workers'
self-management even though it is usually more productive
and efficient than wage labour. The hierarchical nature
of the company ensures that such experiments do not
grow and expand.
<p>
<a href="secF1.html">Section F.1</a>
<br>Slight expansion of <i><b>"Are 
'anarcho'-capitalists really anarchists?"</i></b>
Adds the point we make elsewhere that they cannot 
be considered as anarchists because capitalist 
property, like the state, is hierarchical.
<p>
<a href="append3.html">Anarchism and Marxism</a>
<br>Two new additions to this appendix. The first
one is on <i><b>
<a href="append3.html#app32">Marxists and Spanish 
Anarchism</a></i></b> in which we discuss
various claims made by Marxists (particularly
Trotskyists) about the history and politics of 
the Spanish anarchist movement. The second is a
<a href="append3.html#app33">reply to a Marxist diatribe</a> 
against the various "direct action" and anti-globalisation 
events and organisations, particularly <b>Reclaim the
Streets</b> in London. In addition, 
<a href="append31.html#app12">section 12</a> of the 
appendix on the pamphlet <i><b>"Socialism from

<a href="secB2.html">Section B.2</a>
<br>Expansion and revision on the section 
<i><b>"Why are anarchists against the state?"</b></i>. Indicates
that the state bureaucracy has its own interests and so the
state is not only the tool of the economically dominant class.
Also indicates the role of the state as protector of the
system <b>as a whole</b> and how it does this.

<br>New appendix for replies to on-line anti-anarchist
webpages and works. Currently contains an indepth
reply to the SWP/ISO pamphlet <i><b>"Socialism from 
Below."</b></i>
We expose their <i>"The Myth of Anarchist Libertarianism"</i> 
to be a mish-mash of lies, half-truths and nonsense and

<br>Revision and expansion of our critique of marginalism

<p>
<a href="secJ2.html#secj210">Section J.2.10</a>

apolitical because it rejects electioneering is false.
<p>
<a href="secJ3.html#secj37">Section J.3.7</a>
<br>Slight expansion on Bakunin's ideas on the tactics of 
anarchist groups and why Marxist accounts of them are
false.
<p>
<a href="secJ7.html#secj72">Section J.7.2</a>
<br>Slight change to the end of the section on <i><b>
Is social revolution possible?</i></b> Stresses that
people change themselves when they change the world
and that libertarian characteristics are generated
by struggle and so co-operative/libertarian tendencies
are a product of struggle, not idealised notions with
little basis in reality. 
<p>
<a href="secE7.html">Section E.7</a>
<br>Slight expansion on why Green Consumerism cannot stop

<a href="secA5.html">Section A.5</a>

<a href="secGcon.html">Section G</a>
<br>Revision and expansion of section G which is on the 
Individualist Anarchists. In addition to new arguments
in existing sections on why they were libertarian 
<b><i>socialists</i></b> and <b>not</b> fore-fathers

<a href="secA1.html#seca15">Section A.1.5</a><br>
Expansion of the section on <i><b>Where does anarchism come from?</i></b>.
While still stressing that anarchism is a product of working class struggle
against the modern state and capitalism (and for freedom and equality), 
it also notes that anarchistic tendencies have existed in society before
anarchism existed as a specific political theory.
<p>
<a href="secA2.html#seca27">Section A.2.7</a>
<br>Expansion to the section on <i><b> Why do anarchists argue for

behaviour.
<p>
<a href="secB7.html#secb71">Section B.7.1</a><br>
Inclusion of more information on classes to the section on 
<i><b>But do classes actually exist?</i></b>. International
comparisions show that the US has more poverty and the

in Europe. Not surprisingly, as its more free market based.
