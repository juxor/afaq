    <h1>A.2 What does anarchism stand for?</h1>
<p>These words by Percy Bysshe Shelley gives an idea of what anarchism stands for in practice and what ideals drive it:</p>
<div align="center"><b><i>The man <br>
Of virtuous soul commands not, nor obeys:<br>
Power, like a desolating pestilence,<br>
Pollutes whate'er it touches, and obedience,<br>
Bane of all genius, virtue, freedom, truth,<br>
Makes slaves of men, and, of the human frame,<br>
A mechanised automaton.<br>
</i></b></div>
<p>Â As Shelley's lines suggest, anarchists place a high priority on liberty, desiring it both for themselves and others. They also consider individuality -- that which makes one a unique person -- to be a most important aspect of humanity. They recognise, however, that individuality does not exist in a vacuum but is a <b>social</b> phenomenon. Outside of society, individuality is impossible, since one needs other people in order to develop, expand, and grow.</p>
<p>Moreover, between individual and social development there is a reciprocal  effect: individuals grow within and are shaped by a particular society,  while at the same time they help shape and change aspects of that society  (as well as themselves and other individuals) by their actions and thoughts.  A society not based on free individuals, their hopes, dreams and ideas would  be hollow and dead. Thus, <i>"the making of a human being. . . is a collective process, a process in which both community and the individual <b>participate</b>."</i> [Murray Bookchin, <b>The Modern Crisis</b>, p. 79] Consequently, any political  theory which bases itself purely on the social or the individual is false.</p>
<p>In order for individuality to develop to the fullest possible extent, anarchists consider it essential to create a society based on three principles: <b>liberty</b>, <b>equality</b> and <b>solidarity</b>.  These principles are shared by all anarchists. Thus we find, the communist-anarchist Peter Kropotkin talking about a  revolution inspired by <i>"the beautiful words, Liberty, Equality and  Solidarity."</i> [<b>The Conquest of Bread</b>, p. 128] Individualist-anarchist Benjamin Tucker wrote of a similar vision, arguing that anarchism <i>"insists on Socialism . . . on true Socialism, Anarchistic Socialism: the prevalance on earth of Liberty, Equality, and Solidarity."</i>  [<b>Instead of a Book</b>, p. 363] All three principles are  interdependent.</p>
<p>Liberty is essential for the full flowering of human intelligence, creativity, and dignity. To be dominated by another is to be denied the chance to think and act for oneself, which is the only way to grow and develop one's individuality. Domination also stifles innovation and personal responsibility, leading to conformity and mediocrity. Thus the society that maximises the growth of individuality will necessarily be based on voluntary association, not coercion and authority. To quote Proudhon, <i>"All associated and all free."</i> Or, as Luigi Galleani puts it, anarchism is <i>"the autonomy of the individual within the freedom of association"</i> [<b>The End of Anarchism?</b>, p. 35] (See further  section A.2.2 -- <a href="secA2.html#seca22"> Why do anarchists emphasise liberty?</a>).</p>
<p>If liberty is essential for the fullest development of individuality, then equality is essential for genuine liberty to exist. There can be no real freedom in a class-stratified, hierarchical society riddled with gross inequalities of power, wealth, and privilege. For in such a society only a few -- those at the top of the hierarchy -- are relatively free, while the rest are semi-slaves. Hence without equality, liberty becomes a mockery -- at best the "freedom" to choose one's master (boss), as under capitalism. Moreover, even the elite under such conditions are not really free, because they must live in a stunted society made ugly and barren by the tyranny and alienation of the majority. And since individuality develops to the fullest only with the widest contact with other free individuals, members of the elite are restricted in the possibilities for their own development by the scarcity of free individuals with whom to interact. (See also section A.2.5 -- <a href="secA2.html#seca25">Why are anarchists in favour of equality?</a>)</p>
<p>Finally, solidarity means mutual aid: working voluntarily and co-operatively with others who share the same goals and interests. But without liberty and equality, society becomes a pyramid of competing classes based on the domination of the lower by the higher strata. In such a society, as we know from our own, it's "dominate or be dominated," "dog eat dog," and "everyone for themselves." Thus "rugged individualism" is promoted at the expense of community feeling, with those on the bottom resenting those above them and those on the top fearing those below them.  Under such conditions, there can be no society-wide solidarity, but only a partial form of solidarity within classes whose interests are opposed, which weakens society as a whole. (See also section A.2.6 -- <a href="secA2.html#seca26">Why is solidarity important to anarchists?</a>)</p>
<p>It should be noted that solidarity does not imply self-sacrifice or  self-negation. As Errico Malatesta makes clear:</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>"we are all egoists, we all seek our own satisfaction. But the anarchist  finds his greatest satisfaction in struggling for the good of all, for the achievement of a society in which he [sic] can be a brother among brothers, and among healthy, intelligent, educated, and happy people. But he who is adaptable, who is satisfied to live among slaves and draw profit from the labour of slaves, is not, and cannot be, an anarchist."</i> [<b>Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas</b>, p. 23]   </p></blockquote>
<p>For anarchists, <b>real</b> wealth is other people and the planet on which we live. Or, in the words of Emma Goldman, it <i>"consists in things of utility and  beauty, in things which help to create strong, beautiful bodies and  surroundings inspiring to live in . . . [Our] goal is the freest possible expression of all the latent powers of the individual . . . Such free display of human energy being possible only under complete individual and social freedom,"</i> in other words <i>"social equality."</i> [<b>Red Emma Speaks</b>, pp. 67-8]</p>
<p>Also, honouring individuality does not mean that anarchists are idealists, thinking that people or ideas develop outside of society.  Individuality and ideas grow and develop within society, in response to material and intellectual interactions and experiences, which people actively analyse and interpret. Anarchism, therefore, is a <b>materialist</b> theory, recognising that ideas develop and grow from social interaction and individuals' mental activity (see Michael Bakunin's <b>God and the</b> <b>State</b> for the classic discussion of materialism versus idealism).</p>
<p>This means that an anarchist society will be the creation of human beings, not some deity or other transcendental principle, since <i>"[n]othing ever arranges itself, least of all in human relations. It is men [sic] who do the arranging, and they do it according to their attitudes and understanding of things."</i> [Alexander Berkman, <b>What is Anarchism?</b>, p. 185]</p>
<p>Therefore, anarchism bases itself upon the power of ideas and the ability of people to act and transform their lives based on what they consider to be right. In other words, liberty.</p>
<p><a name="seca21"></a></p>
<h2>A.2.1 What is the essence of anarchism?</h2>
<p>As we have seen, <i>"an-archy"</i> implies <i>"without rulers"</i> or  <i>"without (hierarchical) authority."</i>  Anarchists are not against "authorities" in the sense of experts who are particularly knowledgeable, skilful, or wise, though they believe that such authorities should have no power to force others to follow their recommendations (see <a href="secB1.html#secB1"> section B.1</a> for more  on this distinction). In a nutshell, then, anarchism is anti-authoritarianism.</p>
<p>Anarchists are anti-authoritarians because they believe that no human being should dominate another. Anarchists, in L. Susan Brown's words, <i>"believe in the inherent dignity and worth of the human individual."</i> [<b>The Politics of Individualism</b>, p. 107] Domination is inherently  degrading and demeaning, since it submerges the will and judgement of the  dominated to the will and judgement of the dominators, thus destroying the dignity and self-respect that comes only from personal autonomy. Moreover, domination makes possible and generally leads to exploitation, which is the root of inequality, poverty, and social breakdown.</p>
<p>In other words, then, the essence of anarchism (to express it positively)  is free co-operation between equals to maximise their liberty and  individuality.</p>
<p>Co-operation between equals is the key to anti-authoritarianism. By  co-operation we can develop and protect our own intrinsic value as unique  individuals as well as enriching our lives and liberty for <i>"[n]o individual  can recognise his own humanity, and consequently realise it in his lifetime,  if not by recognising it in others and co-operating in its realisation for  others . . . My freedom is the freedom of all since I am not truly free in thought and in fact, except when my freedom and my rights are confirmed and approved in the freedom and rights of all men [and women] who are my equals."</i>  [Michael Bakunin, quoted by Errico Malatesta, <b>Anarchy</b>, p. 30]</p>
<p>While being anti-authoritarians, anarchists recognise that human beings have a social nature and that they mutually influence each other. We cannot escape the "authority" of this mutual influence, because, as Bakunin reminds us:</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>"The abolition of this mutual influence would be death. And when we advocate the freedom of the masses, we are by no means suggesting the abolition of any of the natural influences that individuals or groups of individuals exert on them. What we want is the abolition of influences which are artificial, privileged, legal, official."</i> [quoted by Malatesta, <b>Anarchy</b>, p. 51]
</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, those influences which stem from hierarchical authority.</p>
<p>This is because hierarchical systems like capitalism deny liberty and,  as a result, people's <i>"mental, moral, intellectual and physical qualities  are dwarfed, stunted and crushed"</i> (see <a href="secB1.html">section B.1</a> for more details).  Thus one of <i>"the grand truths of Anarchism"</i> is that <i>"to be really free  is to allow each one to live their lives in their own way as long as  each allows all to do the same."</i> This is why anarchists fight for a  better society, for a society which respects individuals and their  freedom. Under capitalism, <i>"[e]verything is upon the market for sale:  all is merchandise and commerce"</i> but there are <i>"certain things that are  priceless. Among these are life, liberty and happiness, and these are  things which the society of the future, the free society, will guarantee  to all."</i> Anarchists, as a result, seek to make people aware of their  dignity, individuality and liberty and to encourage the spirit of revolt, resistance and solidarity in those subject to authority. This gets us  denounced by the powerful as being breakers of the peace, but  anarchists consider the struggle for freedom as infinitely better than the peace of slavery. Anarchists, as a result of our ideals, <i>"believe in peace at any price -- except at the price of liberty.  But this precious gift the wealth-producers already seem to have lost.  Life  . . . they have; but what is life worth when it lacks those  elements which make for enjoyment?"</i> [Lucy Parsons, <b>Liberty, Equality  &amp; Solidarity</b>, p. 103, p. 131, p. 103 and p. 134]</p>
<p>So, in a nutshell, Anarchists seek a society in which people interact  in ways which enhance the liberty of all rather than crush the liberty (and so potential) of the many for the benefit of a few. Anarchists do  not want to give others power over themselves, the power to tell them  what to do under the threat of punishment if they do not obey. Perhaps  non-anarchists, rather than be puzzled why anarchists are anarchists,  would be better off asking what it says about themselves that they feel  this attitude needs any sort of explanation.</p>
<p><a name="seca22"></a></p>
<h2>A.2.2 Why do anarchists emphasise liberty?</h2>
<p>An anarchist can be regarded, in Bakunin's words, as a <i>"fanatic lover  of freedom, considering it as the unique environment within which the intelligence, dignity and happiness of mankind can develop and increase."</i>  [<b>Michael Bakunin: Selected Writings</b>, p. 196] Because human beings are thinking  creatures, to deny them liberty is to deny them the opportunity to think  for themselves, which is to deny their very existence as humans. For  anarchists, freedom is a product of our humanity, because:</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>"The very fact. . . that a person has a consciousness of self, of being   different from others, creates a desire to act freely. The craving for   liberty and self-expression is a very fundamental and dominant trait."</i>   [Emma Goldman, <b>Red Emma Speaks</b>, p. 439]Â   </p></blockquote>
<p>For this reason, anarchism <i>"proposes to rescue the self-respect and  independence of the individual from all restraint and invasion by authority.   Only in freedom can man [sic!] grow to his full stature. Only in freedom  will he learn to think and move, and give the very best of himself. Only  in freedom will he realise the true force of the social bonds which tie  men together, and which are the true foundations of a normal social life."</i>   [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, pp. 72-3]</p>
<p>Thus, for anarchists, freedom is basically individuals pursuing their   own good in their own way. Doing so calls forth the activity and power   of individuals as they make decisions for and about themselves and their   lives. Only liberty can ensure individual development and diversity. This  is because when individuals govern themselves and make their own decisions  they have to exercise their minds and this can have no other effect  than expanding and stimulating the individuals involved. As Malatesta put it, <i>"[f]or people to become educated to freedom and the management of their own interests, they must be left to act for themselves, to feel responsibility for their own actions in the good or bad that comes from them. They'd make mistakes, but they'd understand from the consequences where they'd gone wrong and try out new ways."</i> [<b>Fra Contadini</b>, p. 26]</p>
<p>So, liberty is the precondition for the maximum development of  one's individual potential, which is also a social product and can be  achieved only in and through community. A healthy, free community will  produce free individuals, who in turn will shape the community and enrich  the social relationships between the people of whom it is composed.   Liberties, being socially produced, <i>"do not exist because they have been  legally set down on a piece of paper, but only when they have become the  ingrown habit of a people, and when any attempt to impair them will meet  with the violent resistance of the populace . . . One compels respect from  others when one knows how to defend one's dignity as a human being.  This is not only true in private life; it has always been the same in  political life as well."</i> In fact, we <i>"owe all the political rights and privileges which we enjoy today in greater or lesser measures, not to the good will of their governments, but to their own strength."</i> [Rudolf Rocker, <b>Anarcho-syndicalism</b>, p. 75]</p>
<p>It is for this reason anarchists support the tactic of <b><i>"Direct Action"</i></b> (see <a href="secJ2.html">section J.2</a>) for, as Emma Goldman argued,  we have <i>"as much liberty as [we are] willing to take. Anarchism  therefore stands for direct action, the open defiance of, and  resistance to, all laws and restrictions, economic, social, and  moral."</i> It requires <i>"integrity, self-reliance, and courage. In  short, it calls for free, independent spirits"</i> and <i>"only  persistent resistance"</i> can <i>"finally set [us] free. Direct action  against the authority in the shop, direct action against the  authority of the law, direct action against the invasive,  meddlesome authority of our moral code, is the logical,  consistent method of Anarchism."</i> [<b>Red Emma Speaks</b>, pp. 76-7]</p>
<p>Direct action is, in other words, the application of liberty, used to resist oppression in the here and now as well as the  means of creating a free society. It creates the necessary  individual mentality and social conditions in which liberty  flourishes. Both are essential as liberty develops only within  society, not in opposition to it. Thus Murray Bookchin writes:</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>"What freedom, independence, and autonomy people have in a given  historical period is the product of long social traditions and . . . a  <b>collective</b> development -- which is not to deny that individuals play  an important role in that development, indeed are ultimately obliged  to do so if they wish to be free."</i> [<b>Social Anarchism or Lifestyle  Anarchism</b>, p. 15]
</p></blockquote>
<p>But freedom requires the right <b>kind</b> of social environment in which  to grow and develop. Such an environment <b>must</b> be decentralised  and based on the direct management of work by those who do it.  For centralisation means coercive authority (hierarchy), whereas  self-management is the essence of freedom. Self-management  ensures that the individuals involved use (and so develop) all  their abilities -- particularly their mental ones. Hierarchy, in  contrast, substitutes the activities and thoughts of a few for the  activities and thoughts of all the individuals involved. Thus,  rather than developing their abilities to the full, hierarchy  marginalises the many and ensures that their development  is blunted (see also <a href="secB1.html">section B.1</a>).</p>
<p>It is for this reason that anarchists oppose both capitalism and statism.  As the French anarchist Sebastien Faure noted, authority <i>"dresses itself in two principal forms: the political form, that is the State; and the economic form, that is private property."</i> [cited by Peter Marshall, <b>Demanding the Impossible</b>, p. 43] Capitalism, like  the state, is based on centralised authority (i.e. of the boss over the worker), the very purpose of which is to keep the management  of work out of the hands of those who do it. This means <i>"that the  serious, final, complete liberation of the workers is possible only  upon one condition: that of the appropriation of capital, that is,  of raw material and all the tools of labour, including land, by the  whole body of the workers."</i> [Michael Bakunin, quoted by Rudolf Rocker, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 50]</p>
<p>Hence, as Noam Chomsky argues, a <i>"consistent anarchist must oppose  private ownership of the means of production and the wage slavery  which is a component of this system, as incompatible with the principle  that labour  must be freely undertaken and under the control of the  producer."</i> [<i>"Notes on Anarchism"</i>, <b>For Reasons of  State</b>, p. 158]</p>
<p>Thus, liberty for anarchists means a non-authoritarian society in   which individuals and groups practice self-management, i.e. they   govern themselves. The implications of this are important. First, it   implies that an anarchist society will be non-coercive, that is, one   in which violence or the threat of violence will not be used to "convince"  individuals to do anything. Second, it implies that anarchists are firm  supporters of individual sovereignty, and that, because of this support,  they also oppose institutions based on coercive authority, i.e. hierarchy.   And finally, it implies that anarchists' opposition to "government" means   only that they oppose centralised, hierarchical, bureaucratic organisations   or government. They do not oppose self-government through confederations   of decentralised, grassroots organisations, so long as these are based on   direct democracy rather than the delegation of power to "representatives" (see <a href="secA2.html#seca29">section A.2.9</a> for more on anarchist organisation). For authority is the opposite of liberty, and hence any form of organisation   based on the delegation of power is a threat to the liberty and dignity of   the people subjected to that power.</p>
<p>Anarchists consider freedom to be the only social environment within  which human dignity and diversity can flower. Under capitalism and  statism, however, there is no freedom for the majority, as private property  and hierarchy ensure that the inclination and judgement of most individuals  will be subordinated to the will of a master, severely restricting their  liberty and making impossible the <i>"full development of all the material,  intellectual and moral capacities that are latent in every one of us."</i>  [Michael Bakunin, <b>Bakunin on Anarchism</b>,  p. 261] That is why anarchists seek to ensure <i>"that real  justice and real liberty might come on earth"</i> for it is <i>"all false,  all unnecessary, this wild waste of human life, of bone and sinew  and brain and heart, this turning of people into human rags, ghosts,  piteous caricatures of the creatures they had it in them to be, on  the day they were born; that what is called 'economy', the massing  up of things, is in reality the most frightful spending -- the  sacrifice of the maker to the made -- the lose of all the finer  and nobler instincts in the gain of one revolting attribute, the power to count and calculate."</i> [Voltairine de Cleyre, <b>The First Mayday: The Haymarket Speeches 1895-1910</b>, pp, 17-18]</p>
<p>(See  <a href="secBcon.html">section B</a> for further discussion  of the hierarchical and authoritarian nature of capitalism and statism).</p>
<p><a name="seca23"></a></p>
<h2>A.2.3 Are anarchists in favour of organisation?</h2>
<p>Yes. Without association, a truly human life is impossible. Liberty <b>cannot</b> exist without society and organisation. As George Barrett  pointed out:Â </p>
<blockquote><p> <i>"To get the full meaning out of life we must co-operate, and to  co-operate we must make agreements with our fellow-men. But to suppose  that such agreements mean a limitation of freedom is surely an absurdity;  on the contrary, they are the exercise of our freedom.Â </i></p>
<p><i>"If we are going to invent a dogma that to make agreements is to damage  freedom, then at once freedom becomes tyrannical, for it forbids men to  take the most ordinary everyday pleasures. For example, I cannot go for a  walk with my friend because it is against the principle of Liberty that I  should agree to be at a certain place at a certain time to meet him. I  cannot in the least extend my own power beyond myself, because to do so I  must co-operate with someone else, and co-operation implies an agreement,  and that is against Liberty. It will be seen at once that this argument is  absurd. I do not limit my liberty, but simply exercise it, when I agree  with my friend to go for a walk. </i></p>
<p><i>"If, on the other hand, I decide from my superior knowledge that it is good for my friend to take exercise, and therefore I attempt to compel him to go for a walk, then I begin to limit freedom. This is the difference between free agreement and government."</i> [<b>Objections to Anarchism</b>, pp. 348-9]Â </p>
</blockquote>
<p>As far as organisation goes, anarchists think that <i>"far from  creating authority, [it] is the only cure for it and the only  means whereby each of  us will get used to taking an active and conscious part in collective  work, and cease being passive instruments in the hands of leaders."</i>  [Errico Malatesta, <b>Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas</b>, p. 86] Thus  anarchists are well aware of the need to organise in a structured and  open manner. As Carole Ehrlich points out, while anarchists <i>"aren't  opposed to structure"</i> and simply <i>"want to abolish <b>hierarchical</b>  structure"</i> they are <i>"almost always stereotyped as wanting no structure  at all."</i> This is not the case, for <i>"organisations that would build in  accountability, diffusion of power among the maximum number of persons,  task rotation, skill-sharing, and the spread of information and resources"</i>  are based on <i>"good social anarchist principles of organisation!"</i>  [<i>"Socialism, Anarchism and Feminism"</i>, <b>Quiet Rumours: An Anarcha-Feminist  Reader</b>, p. 47 and p. 46]</p>
<p>The fact that anarchists are in favour of organisation may seem strange  at first, but it is understandable. <i>"For those with experience only of authoritarian organisation,"</i> argue two British anarchists, <i>"it appears that organisation can only be totalitarian or democratic, and that  those who disbelieve in government must by that token disbelieve in organisation at all. That is not so."</i> [Stuart Christie and Albert Meltzer, <b>The Floodgates of Anarchy</b>, p. 122] In other words, because  we live in a society in which virtually all forms of organisation are  authoritarian, this makes them appear to be the only kind possible.  What is usually not recognised is that this mode of  organisation is historically conditioned, arising within a specific  kind of society -- one whose motive principles are domination and  exploitation. According to archaeologists and anthropologists, this kind of society has only existed for about 5,000 years, having appeared with the first primitive states based on conquest and slavery, in which the labour of slaves created a surplus which supported a ruling class.</p>
<p>Prior to that time, for hundreds of thousands of years, human and proto-human societies were what Murray Bookchin calls <i>"organic,"</i> that is, based on co-operative forms of economic activity involving mutual aid, free access to productive resources, and a sharing of the products of communal labour according to need. Although such societies probably had status rankings based on age, there were no hierarchies in the sense of institutionalised dominance-subordination relations enforced by coercive sanctions and resulting in class-stratification involving the economic exploitation of one class by another (see Murray Bookchin, <b>The Ecology of Freedom</b>).</p>
<p>It must be emphasised, however, that anarchists do <b>not</b> advocate  going "back to the Stone Age." We merely note that since the hierarchical-authoritarian mode of organisation is a relatively recent development in the course of human social evolution, there is no reason to suppose that it is somehow "fated" to be permanent. We do not think that human beings are genetically "programmed" for authoritarian, competitive, and aggressive behaviour, as there is no credible evidence to support this claim. On the contrary, such behaviour is socially conditioned, or <b>learned</b>, and as such, can be <b>unlearned</b> (see Ashley Montagu,  <b>The Nature of Human Aggression</b>). We are not fatalists or genetic determinists, but believe in free will, which means that people can change the way they do things, including the way they organise society.</p>
<p>And there is no doubt that society needs to be better organised, because presently most of its wealth -- which is produced by the majority -- and  power gets distributed to a small, elite minority at the top of the social  pyramid, causing deprivation and suffering for the rest, particularly for  those at the bottom.  Yet because this elite controls the means of coercion  through its control of the state (see <a href="secB2.html#secb23"> section  B.2.3</a>), it is able to suppress  the majority and ignore its suffering -- a phenomenon that occurs on a  smaller scale within all hierarchies. Little wonder, then, that people  within authoritarian and centralised structures come to hate them as a  denial of their freedom. As Alexander Berkman puts it:</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>"Any one who tells you that Anarchists don't believe in organisation is talking nonsense. Organisation is everything, and everything is organisation. The whole of life is organisation, conscious or  unconscious . . . But there is organisation and organisation.  Capitalist society is so badly organised that its various members suffer:   just as when you have a pain in some part of you, your whole body aches   and you are ill. . . , not a single member of the organisation or union   may with impunity be discriminated against, suppressed or ignored. To do   so would be the same as to ignore an aching tooth: you would be sick all   over."</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 198]
</p></blockquote>
<p>Yet this is precisely what happens in capitalist society, with the  result that it is, indeed, <i>"sick all over."</i></p>
<p>For these reasons, anarchists reject authoritarian forms of organisation and instead support associations based on free agreement. Free agreement  is important because, in Berkman's words, <i>"[o]nly when each is a  free and independent unit, co-operating with others from his own choice because of  mutual interests, can the world work successfully and become powerful."</i>  [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 199] As we discuss in  <a href="secA2.html#seca214">section A.2.14</a>, anarchists stress that free agreement has to be complemented by direct democracy (or, as it is usually called by anarchists, self-management) within the association  itself otherwise "freedom" become little more than picking masters.</p>
<p>Anarchist organisation is based on a massive decentralisation of power  back into the hands of the people, i.e. those who are directly affected  by the decisions being made. To quote Proudhon:</p>
<blockquote><p><i> "Unless democracy is a fraud and the sovereignty of the People a joke, it must be admitted that each citizen in the sphere of his [or her] industry, each municipal, district or provincial council within its own territory . . . should act directly and by itself  in administering the interests which it includes, and should  exercise full sovereignty in relation to them."</i> [<b>General Idea of the Revolution</b>,  p. 276]
</p></blockquote>
<p>It also implies a need for federalism to co-ordinate joint interests.  For anarchism, federalism is the natural complement to self-management.  With the abolition of the State, society <i>"can, and must, organise itself in a different fashion, but not from top to bottom . . . The future social organisation must be made solely from the bottom upwards, by the free association or federation of workers, firstly in their unions, then in the communes, regions, nations and finally in a  great federation, international and universal. Then alone will be realised the true and life-giving order of freedom and the common good, that order which, far from denying, on the contrary affirms and brings into harmony the interests of individuals and of society."</i> [Bakunin, <b>Michael Bakunin: Selected Writings</b>, pp. 205-6] Because a <i>"truly popular organisation begins . . . from below"</i> and so <i>"federalism becomes a political institution of Socialism, the free and spontaneous  organisation of popular life."</i> Thus libertarian socialism <i>"is  federalistic in character."</i> [Bakunin, <b>The Political Philosophy of Bakunin</b>, pp. 273-4 and p. 272]</p>
<p>Therefore, anarchist organisation is based on direct democracy (or self-management) and federalism (or confederation). These are the  expression and environment of liberty. Direct (or participatory)  democracy is essential because liberty and equality imply the need  for forums within which people can discuss and debate as equals and  which allow for the free exercise of what Murray Bookchin calls  <i>"the creative role of dissent."</i> Federalism is necessary to ensure that common interests are discussed and joint activity organised in a way which reflects the wishes of all those affected by them. To ensure that decisions flow from the bottom up rather than being  imposed from the top down by a few rulers.</p>
<p>Anarchist ideas on libertarian organisation and the need for direct democracy and confederation will be discussed further in sections <a href="secA2.html#seca29"> A.2.9</a> and <a href="secA2.html#seca211"> A.2.11</a>.</p>
<p><a name="seca24"></a></p>
<h2>A.2.4 Are anarchists in favour of "absolute" liberty?</h2>
<p>No. Anarchists do not believe that everyone should be able to <i>"do</i> <i>whatever they like,"</i> because some actions invariably involve the denial of the liberty of others.</p>
<p>For example, anarchists do not support the "freedom" to rape, to exploit, or  to coerce others. Neither do we tolerate authority. On the contrary, since  authority is a threat to liberty, equality, and solidarity (not to mention  human dignity), anarchists recognise the need to resist and overthrow it.</p>
<p>The exercise of authority is not freedom. No one has a "right" to rule  others. As Malatesta points out, anarchism supports <i>"freedom for  everybody . . . with the only limit of the equal freedom for others; which  does <b>not</b> mean . . . that we recognise, and wish to respect, the  'freedom' to exploit, to oppress, to command, which is oppression and  certainly not freedom." </i>[<b>Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas</b>, p. 53]</p>
<p>In a capitalist society, resistance to all forms of hierarchical authority is the mark of a free person -- be it private (the boss) or public (the state). As Henry David Thoreau pointed out in his essay on <b>"Civil</b> <b>Disobedience"</b> (1847)</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>"Disobedience is the true foundation of liberty. The obedient must be slaves."</i>

<h2>A.2.5 Why are anarchists in favour of equality?</h2>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="secA2.html">above</a>, anarchists are dedicated to  social equality because it is the only context in which individual liberty  can flourish. However, there has been much nonsense written about  "equality," and much of what is commonly believed about it is very strange indeed. Before discussing what anarchist <b>do</b> mean by equality, we have to indicate what we <b>do not</b> mean by it.</p>
<p>Anarchists do <b>not</b> believe in <i>"equality of endowment,"</i> which is not only  non-existent but would be <b>very</b> undesirable if it could be brought about. Everyone is unique. Biologically determined human differences not only exist but are <i>"a cause for joy, not fear or regret."</i> Why?  Because <i>"life among clones would not be worth living, and a sane  person will only rejoice that others have abilities that they do not share." </i> [Noam Chomsky, <b>Marxism, Anarchism, and Alternative Futures</b>, p. 782]</p>
<p>That some people <b>seriously</b> suggest that anarchists means by "equality" that  everyone should be <b>identical</b> is a sad reflection on the state of present-day  intellectual culture and the corruption of words -- a corruption used to divert attention from an unjust and authoritarian system and side-track people into discussions of biology. <i>"The uniqueness of the self in no way contradicts the principle of equality,"</i> noted Erich Fromm, <i>"The thesis that men are born equal implies that they all share the same fundamental human qualities, that they share the same basic fate of human beings, that they all have the same inalienable claim on freedom and happiness. It furthermore means that their relationship is one of solidarity, not one of domination-submission. What the concept of equality  does not mean is that all men are alike."</i> [<b>The Fear of Freedom</b>, p. 228] Thus it would be fairer to say that anarchists seek equality <b>because</b> we recognise that everyone is different and, consequently, seek the full affirmation and development of that uniqueness.</p>
<p>Nor are anarchists in favour of so-called <i>"equality of outcome."</i> We have <b>no</b> desire to live in a society were everyone gets the same goods, lives in the same kind of house, wears the same uniform, etc. Part of the reason for the anarchist revolt against capitalism and statism is that they standardise so much of life (see George Reitzer's <b>The McDonaldisation  of Society</b> on why capitalism is driven towards standardisation and  conformity). In the words of Alexander Berkman:</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>"The spirit of authority, law, written and unwritten, tradition and custom force us into a common grove and make a man [or woman] a will-less automation without independence or individuality. . .  All of us are its victims, and only the exceptionally strong succeed in breaking its chains, and that only partly."</i> [<b>What is Anarchism?</b>, p. 165]
</p></blockquote>
<p>Anarchists, therefore, have little to desire to make this <i>"common grove"</i> even deeper. Rather, we desire to destroy it and every social relationship and institution that creates it in the first place.</p>
<p><i>"Equality of outcome"</i> can only be introduced and maintained by force, which  would <b>not</b> be equality anyway, as some would have more power than others!  <i>"Equality of outcome"</i> is particularly hated by anarchists, as we recognise  that every individual has different needs, abilities, desires and interests.  To make all consume the same would be tyranny. Obviously, if one person needs  medical treatment and another does not, they do not receive an "equal" amount  of medical care. The same is true of other human needs. As Alexander  Berkman put it:</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>"equality does not mean  an equal amount but equal <b>opportunity</b>. . . Do not make the mistake of identifying equality in liberty with the forced equality of the convict camp. True anarchist equality implies freedom, not quantity. It does not mean that every one must eat, drink, or wear the same things, do the same work, or live in the same manner. Far from it: the very reverse in fact."<br>
</i></p>
<p><i>"Individual needs and tastes differ, as appetites differ. It is <b>equal opportunity to satisfy</b> them that constitutes true equality.  </i></p>
<p><i>"Far from levelling, such equality opens the door for the greatest possible variety of activity and development. For human character  is diverse . . . Free opportunity of expressing and acting out  your individuality means development of natural dissimilarities and variations."</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, pp. 164-5]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For anarchists, the "concepts" of "equality" as "equality of outcome" or "equality of endowment" are meaningless. However, in a hierarchical society, "equality of opportunity" and "equality of outcome" <b>are</b>  related. Under capitalism, for example, the opportunities each  generation face are dependent on the outcomes of the previous ones.  This means that under capitalism "equality of opportunity" without  a rough "equality of outcome" (in the sense of income and resources) becomes meaningless, as there is no real equality of opportunity for  the off-spring of a millionaire and that of a road sweeper. Those  who argue for "equality of opportunity" while ignoring the barriers  created by previous outcomes indicate that they do not know what  they are talking about -- opportunity in a hierarchical society  depends not only on an open road but also upon an equal start.  From this obvious fact springs the misconception that anarchists  desire "equality of outcome" -- but this applies to a hierarchical  system, in a free society this would not the case (as we will see).</p>
<p>Equality, in anarchist theory, does not mean denying individual  diversity or uniqueness. As Bakunin observes:</p>
<blockquote><p><i> "once equality has triumphed and is well established, will various  individuals' abilities and their levels of energy cease to differ? Some will exist, perhaps not so many as now, but certainly some will always exist. It is proverbial that the same tree never bears two  identical leaves, and this will probably be always be true. And it is even more truer with regard to human beings, who are much  more complex than leaves. But this diversity is hardly an evil. On the contrary. . . it is a resource of the human race. Thanks to this diversity, humanity is a collective whole in which the one individual   complements all the others and needs them. As a result, this infinite   diversity of human individuals is the fundamental cause and the very  basis of their solidarity. It is all-powerful argument for  equality."</i> [<i>"All-Round Education"</i>, <b>The Basic  Bakunin</b>, pp. 117-8]
</p></blockquote>
<p>Equality for anarchists means <b>social</b> equality, or, to use Murray  Bookchin's term, the <b><i>"equality of unequals"</i></b> (some like Malatesta used the term <b><i>"equality of conditions"</i></b> to express the same idea). By  this he means that an anarchist society recognises the differences in  ability and need of individuals but does not allow these differences to  be turned into power. Individual differences, in other words, <i> "would  be of  no consequence, because inequality in fact is lost in the  collectivity when it cannot cling to some legal fiction or institution."</i>  [Michael Bakunin, <b>God and the State</b>, p. 53]</p>
<p>If hierarchical social relationships, and the forces that create them,  are abolished in favour of ones that encourage participation and  are based on the principle of "one person, one vote" then natural  differences would not be able to be turned into hierarchical power.  For example, without capitalist property rights there would not be  means by which a minority could monopolise the means of life  (machinery and land) and enrich themselves by the work of  others via the wages system and usury (profits, rent and interest).  Similarly, if workers manage their own work, there is no class of  capitalists to grow rich off their labour. Thus Proudhon:</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>"Now, what can be the origin of this inequality?<br>
</i></p>
<p><i>"As we see it, . . . that origin is the realisation within society of this triple abstraction: capital, labour and talent. </i></p>
<p><i>"It is because society has divided itself into three categories of citizen corresponding to the three terms of the formula. . . that caste distinctions have always been arrived at, and one half of the human race enslaved to the other. . . socialism thus consists of reducing the aristocratic formula of capital-labour-talent into the simpler formula of labour!. . . in order to make every citizen simultaneously, equally and to the same extent capitalist, labourer and expert or artist."</i> [<b>No Gods, No Masters</b>,  vol. 1, pp. 57-8]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like all anarchists, Proudhon saw this integration of functions as the key to equality and freedom and proposed self-management as the means to achieve it. Thus self-management is the key to  social equality. Social equality in the workplace, for example,  means that everyone has an equal say in the policy decisions on  how the workplace develops and changes. Anarchists are strong  believers in the maxim "that which touches all, is decided by all."</p>
<p>This does not mean, of course, that expertise will be ignored or that everyone will decide everything. As far as expertise goes, different people have different interests, talents, and abilities, so obviously they will want to study different things and do different kinds of work. It is also obvious that when people are ill they consult a doctor -- an expert -- who manages his or her own work rather than being directed by a committee. We are sorry to have to bring these points up, but once the topics of social equality and workers' self-management come up, some people start to talk nonsense. It is common sense that a hospital managed in a socially equal way will <b>not</b> involve non-medical staff voting on  how doctors should perform an operation!</p>
<p>In fact, social equality and individual liberty are inseparable. Without the collective self-management of decisions that affect a group (equality) to complement the individual self-management of decisions that affect the individual (liberty), a free society is impossible. For without both, some will have power over others, making decisions <b>for</b> them (i.e. governing them), and thus some will be more free than others. Which implies, just to state the obvious, anarchists seek equality in <b>all</b> aspects of life, not just in terms of wealth. Anarchists <i>"demand for every person not just his [or her] entire measure  of the wealth of society but also his [or her] portion of social power."</i>  [Malatesta and Hamon, <b>No Gods, No Masters</b>, vol. 2, p. 20] Thus self-management is needed to ensure both liberty <b>and</b> equality.</p>
<p>Social equality is required for individuals to both govern and express  themselves, for the self-management it implies means <i>"people working  in face-to-face relations with their fellows in order to bring the  uniqueness of their own perspective to the business of solving  common problems and achieving common goals."</i> [George Benello,  <b>From the Ground Up</b>, p. 160] Thus equality allows the expression  of individuality and so is a necessary base for individual liberty.</p>
<p>Section F.3 (<a href="secF3.html">"Why do 'anarcho'-capitalists  place little or no value on equality?"</a>) discusses anarchist ideas on equality  further. Noam Chomsky's essay <i>"Equality"</i> (contained in <b>The Chomsky Reader</b>) is a good summary of libertarian ideas on the subject.</p>
<p><a name="seca26"></a></p>
<h2>A.2.6 Why is solidarity important to anarchists?</h2>
<p>Solidarity, or mutual aid, is a key idea of anarchism. It is the link between the individual and society, the means by which individuals can work together to meet their common interests in an environment that supports and nurtures both liberty and equality. For anarchists, mutual aid is a fundamental feature of human life, a source of both strength and happiness and a fundamental requirement for a fully human existence.</p>
<p>Erich Fromm, noted psychologist and socialist humanist, points out that the <i>"human desire to experience union with others is rooted in the specific conditions of existence that characterise the human species and is one of the strongest motivations of human behaviour."</i> [<b>To Be or To Have</b>, p.107]</p>
<p>Therefore anarchists consider the desire to form "unions" (to use Max Stirner's term) with other people to be a natural need. These unions, or associations, must be based on equality and individuality in order to be fully satisfying to those who join them -- i.e. they must be organised in an anarchist manner, i.e. voluntary, decentralised, and non-hierarchical.</p>
<p>Solidarity -- co-operation between individuals -- is necessary for  life and is far from a denial of liberty. Solidarity, observed  Errico Malatesta, <i>"is the only environment in which Man can express his personality and achieve his optimum development and enjoy the greatest possible wellbeing."</i> This <i>"coming together of individuals for the wellbeing of all, and of all for the wellbeing of each,"</i>  results in <i>"the freedom of each not being limited by, but  complemented -- indeed finding the necessary <b>raison d'etre</b> in  -- the freedom of others."</i> [<b>Anarchy</b>, p. 29] In other words, solidarity and co-operation means treating each other as equals, refusing to treat others as means to an end and creating relationships which support freedom for all rather than a few dominating the many. Emma Goldman reiterated this theme, noting <i>"what wonderful results  this unique force of man's individuality has achieved when strengthened  by co-operation with other individualities . . . co-operation -- as  opposed to internecine strife and struggle -- has worked for the  survival and evolution of the species. . . . only mutual aid and  voluntary co-operation . . . can create the basis for a free  individual and associational life."</i> [<b>Red Emma Speaks</b>, p. 118]</p>
<p>Solidarity means associating together as equals in order to satisfy our common interests and needs. Forms of association not based on solidarity (i.e. those based on inequality) will crush the individuality of those subjected to them. As Ret Marut points out, liberty needs solidarity, the recognition of common interests:</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>"The most noble, pure and true love of mankind is the love  of oneself. <b>I</b> want to be free! <b>I</b> hope to be  happy! <b>I</b> want to appreciate all the beauties of the  world. But my freedom is secured <b>only</b> when all  other people around me are free. I can only be happy when all other people  around me are happy. I can only be joyful when all the people I see and  meet look at the world with joy-filled eyes. And <b>only</b> then  can I eat my fill with pure enjoyment when I have the secure knowledge that other  people, too, can eat their fill as I do. And for that reason it is a  question of <b>my own contentment</b>, only of <b>my own  self</b>, when I rebel against every danger which threatens  my freedom and my happiness. . ."</i> [Ret Marut (a.k.a. B. Traven),  <b>The BrickBurner</b> magazine quoted by Karl S. Guthke, <b>B. Traven: The life behind the legends</b>, pp. 133-4]
</p></blockquote>
<p>To practice solidarity means that we recognise, as in the slogan of <b>Industrial Workers of the World</b>, that <i>"an injury to one  is an injury to all."</i>  Solidarity, therefore, is the means to protect individuality and  liberty and so is an expression of self-interest. As Alfie Kohn points out:</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>"when we think about co-operation. . . we tend to associate the concept  with fuzzy-minded idealism. . . This may result from confusing co-operation  with altruism. . . Structural co-operation defies the usual egoism/altruism  dichotomy. It sets things up so that by helping you I am helping myself at  the same time. Even if my motive initially may have been selfish, our fates  now are linked. We sink or swim together. Co-operation is a shrewd and highly  successful strategy - a pragmatic choice that gets things done at work and  at school even more effectively than competition does. . . There is also  good evidence that co-operation is more conductive to psychological health  and to liking one another."</i> [<b>No Contest: The Case Against  Competition</b>, p. 7]
</p></blockquote>
<p>And, within a hierarchical society, solidarity is important not only because of the satisfaction it gives us, but also because it is necessary to resist those in power. Malatesta's words are relevant here:</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>"the oppressed masses who have never completely resigned themselves to oppress and poverty, and who . . . show themselves thirsting for justice, freedom and wellbeing, are beginning to understand that they will not be able to achieve their emancipation except by union and solidarity with all the oppressed, with the exploited everywhere in the world."</i> [<b>Anarchy</b>, p. 33]
</p></blockquote>
<p>By standing together, we can increase our strength and get what we want. Eventually, by organising into groups, we can start to manage our own collective affairs together and so replace the boss once and for all. <i>"<b>Unions</b> will. . . multiply the individual's means and secure his assailed property."</i> [Max Stirner, <b>The Ego and Its Own</b>, p. 258] By acting in solidarity, we can also replace the current system with one more to our liking: <i>"in union there is strength."</i> [Alexander Berkman, <b>What is Anarchism?</b>, p. 74]</p>
<p>Solidarity is thus the means by which we can obtain and ensure our own freedom. We agree to work together so that we will not have to work for <b>another</b>. By agreeing to share with each other we increase our options so that we may enjoy <b>more</b>, not less. Mutual aid is in my self-interest --  that is, I see that it is to my advantage to reach agreements with others  based on mutual respect and social equality; for if I dominate someone,  this means that the conditions exist which allow domination, and so in  all probability I too will be dominated in turn.</p>
<p>As Max Stirner saw, solidarity is the means by which we ensure that our liberty is strengthened and defended from those in power who want to rule us: <i>"Do you yourself count for nothing then?"</i>, he asks. <i>"Are you bound to let anyone do anything he wants to you? Defend yourself and no one will touch you. If millions of people are behind you, supporting you, then you are a formidable force and you will win without difficulty."</i> [quoted in Luigi Galleani's  <b>The End of Anarchism?</b>, p. 79 - different translation in <b>The Ego  and Its Own</b>, p. 197]</p>
<p>Solidarity, therefore, is important to anarchists because it is the means by which liberty can be created and defended against power. Solidarity is strength and a product of our nature as social beings. However, solidarity  should not be confused with "herdism," which implies passively following a leader. In order to be effective, solidarity must be created by free people,  co-operating together as <b>equals</b>. The "big WE" is <b>not</b> solidarity, although  the desire for "herdism" is a product of our need for solidarity and union.  It is a "solidarity" corrupted by hierarchical society, in which people are  conditioned to blindly obey leaders.</p>
<p><a name="seca27"></a></p>
<h2>A.2.7 Why do anarchists argue for self-liberation?</h2>
<p>Liberty, by its very nature, cannot be given. An individual cannot be freed by another, but must break his or her own chains through their own effort. Of course, self-effort can also be part of collective action, and in many cases it has to be in order to attain its ends. As Emma Goldman points out:</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>"History tells us that every oppressed class [or group or individual]  gained true liberation from its masters by its own efforts." </i> [<b>Red Emma Speaks</b>, p. 167]
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is because anarchists recognise that hierarchical systems, like any social relationship, shapes those subject to them. As Bookchin argued, "<i>class societies organise our psychic structures  for command or obedience."</i> This means that people <b><i>internalise</i></b>  the values of hierarchical and class society and, as such, <i>"the  State is not merely a constellation of bureaucratic and coercive instituions. It is also a state of mind, an instilled mentality for ordering reality . . . Its capacity to rule by brute force has always been limited . . . Without a high degree of co-operation from even the most victimised classes of society such as chattel slaves and serfs, its authority would eventually dissipate. Awe and apathy in the face of State power are products of social conditioning that renders this very power possible."</i> [<b>The Ecology of Freedom</b>, p. 159 and pp. 164-5] Self-liberation is the means by which we break down both internal <b><i>and</i></b> external chains, freeing ourselves mentally as well as physically.</p>
<p>Anarchists have long argued that people can only free themselves by their own actions. The various methods anarchists suggest to aid this process will be discussed in section J (<a href="secJcon.html">"What Do  Anarchists Do?"</a>) and will not be discussed here. However, these methods all involve people organising themselves, setting their own agendas, and acting in ways that empower them and eliminate their dependence on leaders to do things for them. Anarchism is based on people <i>"acting for themselves"</i> (performing what anarchists call <b><i>"direct action"</i></b> -- see  <a href="secJ2.html">section J.2</a> for details).</p>
<p>Direct action has an empowering and liberating effect on those involved in it. Self-activity is the means by which the creativity, initiative, imagination and critical thought of those subjected to authority can be developed. It is the means by which society can be changed. As Errico  Malatesta pointed out:</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>"Between man and his social environment there is a reciprocal action.  Men make society what it is and society makes men what they are, and  the result is therefore a kind of vicious circle. To transform society  men [and women] must be changed, and to transform men, society must be  changed . . . Fortunately existing society has not been created by  the inspired will of a dominating class, which has succeeded in  reducing all its subjects to passive and unconscious instruments of  its interests. It is the result of a thousand internecine struggles,  of a thousand human and natural factors . . .<br>
</i></p>
<p><i>"From this the possibility of progress . . . We must take advantage of all the means, all the possibilities and the opportunities that the present environment allows us to act on our fellow men [and  women] and to develop their consciences and their demands . . .  to claim and to impose those major social transformations which are possible and which effectively serve to open the way to  further advances later . . . We must seek to get all the people . . . to make demands, and impose itself and take for itself all the improvements and freedoms it desires as and when it reaches the state of wanting them, and the power to demand them . . .  we must push the people to want always more and to increase its  pressures [on the ruling elite], until it has achieved complete  emancipation."</i> [<b>Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas</b>,  pp. 188-9]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Society, while shaping all individuals, is also created by them, through their actions, thoughts, and ideals. Challenging institutions that limit one's freedom is mentally liberating, as it sets in motion the process of questioning authoritarian relationships in general. This process gives us insight into how society works, changing our ideas and creating new ideals. To quote Emma Goldman again: <i>"True emancipation begins. . . in woman's soul."</i> And in a man's too, we might add. It is only here that we can <i>"begin [our] inner regeneration, [cutting] loose from the weight of prejudices, traditions and customs."</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 167] But this process must be self-directed, for as Max Stirner notes, <i>"the man who is set free is nothing but a freed man. . . a dog dragging a piece of chain with him."</i> [<b>The Ego and Its Own</b>, p. 168] By changing the world, even in a small way, we change ourselves.</p>
<p>In an interview during the Spanish Revolution, the Spanish anarchist militant Durutti said, <i>"we have a new world in our hearts."</i> Only self-activity and self-liberation allows us to create such a vision  and gives us the confidence to try to actualise it in the real world.</p>
<p>Anarchists, however, do not think that self-liberation must wait  for the future, after the "glorious revolution." The personal is political, and given the nature of society, how we act in the here and now will influence the future of our society and our lives. Therefore, even in  pre-anarchist society anarchists try to create, as Bakunin puts it,  <i>"not only the ideas but also the facts of the future itself."</i>  We can do so by creating alternative social  relationships and organisations, acting as free people in a  non-free society. Only by our actions in the here and now can  we lay the foundation for a free society. Moreover, this process  of self-liberation goes on all the time:</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>"Subordinates of all kinds exercise their capacity for critical  self-reflection every day -- that is why masters are thwarted, frustrated and, sometimes, overthrown. But unless masters are overthrown, unless subordinates engage in political activity, no amount of critical reflection will end their subjection and bring them freedom."</i> [Carole Pateman, <b>The Sexual Contract</b>,  p. 205]
</p></blockquote>
<p>Anarchists aim to encourage these tendencies in everyday life  to reject, resist and thwart authority and bring them to their logical conclusion -- a society of free individuals, co-operating as equals in free, self-managed associations. Without this process of critical self-reflection, resistance and self-liberation a free society is impossible. Thus, for anarchists, anarchism comes from the natural resistance of subordinated people striving to act as free individuals within a hierarchical world. This process of resistance is called by many anarchists the <b><i>"class  struggle"</i></b> (as  it is working class people who are generally the most subordinated  group within society) or, more generally, <b><i>"social struggle."</i></b>  It is this everyday resistance to authority (in all its forms) and the  desire for freedom which is the key to the anarchist revolution. It is for this reason that <i>"anarchists emphasise over and over  that the class struggle provides the only means for the workers  [and other oppressed groups] to achieve control over their destiny."</i> [Marie-Louise Berneri, <b>Neither East Nor West</b>,  p. 32]</p>
<p>Revolution is a process, not an event, and every  <i>"spontaneous revolutionary action"</i> usually results  from and is based upon the patient work of many years of  organisation and education by people with "utopian" ideas. The  process of "creating the new world in the shell of the old" (to use  another <b>I.W.W.</b> expression), by building alternative  institutions and relationships, is but one component of what  must be a long tradition of revolutionary commitment and  militancy.</p>
<p>As Malatesta made clear, <i>"to encourage popular  organisations of all kinds is the logical consequence  of our basic ideas, and should therefore be an integral  part of our programme. . . anarchists do not want to emancipate  the people; we want the people to emancipate themselves. . . ,  we want the new way of life to emerge from the body of the  people and correspond to the state of their development  and advance as they advance."</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 90]</p>
<p>Unless a process of self-emancipation occurs, a free society is  impossible. Only when individuals free themselves, both materially  (by abolishing the state and capitalism) and intellectually (by  freeing themselves of submissive attitudes towards authority),  can a free society be possible. We should not forget that capitalist  and state power, to a great extent, is power over the minds of those  subject to them (backed up, of course, with sizeable force if the mental domination fails and people start rebelling and resisting). In  effect, a spiritual power as the ideas of the ruling class dominate  society and permeate the minds of the oppressed. As long as this  holds, the working class will acquiesce to authority, oppression  and exploitation as the normal condition of life. Minds submissive  to the doctrines and positions of their masters cannot hope to win  freedom, to revolt and fight. Thus the oppressed must overcome the  mental domination of the existing system before they can throw  off its yoke (and, anarchists argue, direct action is the means  of doing both -- see sections <a href="secJ2.html">J.2</a>  and <a href="secJ4.html">J.4</a>). Capitalism and statism  must be beaten spiritually and theoretically before it is beaten  materially (many anarchists call this mental liberation <b><i>"class consciousness"</i></b> -- see <a href="secB7.html#secb74">section B.7.4</a>). And self-liberation through  struggle against oppression is the only way this can be done. Thus anarchists encourage (to use Kropotkin's term) <b><i>"the spirit of revolt."</i></b></p>
<p>Self-liberation is a product of struggle, of self-organisation, solidarity and direct action. Direct action is the means of creating  anarchists, free people, and so <i>"Anarchists have always advised  taking an active part in those workers' organisations which carry  on the <b>direct</b> struggle of Labour against Capital and its protector,  -- the State."</i> This is because <i>"[s]uch a struggle . . . better than  any indirect means, permits the worker to obtain some temporary  improvements in the present conditions of work, while it opens his  [or her] eyes to the evil that is done by Capitalism and the State  that supports it, and wakes up his [or her] thoughts concerning the  possibility of organising consumption, production and exchange without  the intervention of the capitalist and the state,"</i> that is, see the possibility of a free society. Kropotkin, like many anarchists, pointed to the Syndicalist and Trade Union movements as a means of developing libertarian ideas within existing society (although he, like most anarchists, did not limit anarchist activity exclusively to them). Indeed, any movement which <i>"permit[s] the working men [and women] to realise their solidarity and to feel the community of their interests . . . prepare[s] the way for these conceptions"</i>  of communist-anarchism, i.e. the overcoming the spiritual domination of existing society within the minds of the oppressed. [<b>Evolution and  Environment</b>, p. 83 and p. 85]</p>
<p>For anarchists, in the words of a Scottish Anarchist militant, the  <i>"history of human progress [is] seen as the history of rebellion and  disobedience, with the individual debased by subservience to authority  in its many forms and able to retain his/her dignity only through  rebellion and disobedience."</i> [Robert Lynn, <b>Not a Life Story, Just a  Leaf from It</b>, p. 77] This is why anarchists stress self-liberation  (and self-organisation, self-management and self-activity). Little wonder Bakunin considered <i>"rebellion"</i> as one of the  <i>"three fundamental principles [which] constitute the essential  conditions of all human development, collective or individual, in  history."</i> [<b>God and the State</b>, p. 12] This is simply because individuals and  groups cannot be freed by others, only by themselves. Such  rebellion (self-liberation) is the <b>only</b> means by which existing  society becomes more libertarian and an anarchist society a possibility.</p>

<h2>A.2.8 Is it possible to be an anarchist without opposing hierarchy?</h2>
<p>No. We have seen that anarchists abhor authoritarianism. But if one is an anti-authoritarian, one must oppose all hierarchical institutions,  since they embody the principle of authority. For, as Emma Goldman argued, <i>"it is not only government in the sense of the state which is destructive of every individual value and quality. It is the whole complex authority and institutional domination which  strangles life. It is the superstition, myth, pretence, evasions,  and subservience which support authority and institutional  domination."</i> [<b>Red Emma Speaks</b>, p. 435] This means that  <i>"there is and will always  be a need to discover and overcome structures of hierarchy, authority  and domination and constraints on freedom: slavery, wage-slavery  [i.e. capitalism], racism, sexism, authoritarian schools, etc."</i>  [Noam Chomsky, <b>Language and Politics</b>, p. 364]</p>
<p>Thus the consistent anarchist must oppose hierarchical relationships as well as the state. Whether economic, social or political, to be an anarchist means to oppose hierarchy. The argument for this (if  anybody needs one) is as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p><i> "All authoritarian institutions are organised as pyramids: the state, the private or public corporation, the army, the police, the church, the university, the hospital: they are all pyramidal structures with a small group of decision-makers at the top and a broad base of people whose decisions are <b>made for them</b> at the bottom. Anarchism does not demand the changing of labels on the layers, it doesn't want different people on top, it wants <b>us</b> to clamber out from underneath."</i> [Colin Ward, <b>Anarchy in Action</b>, p. 22]
</p></blockquote>
<p>Hierarchies <i>"share a common feature: they are organised systems of  command and obedience"</i> and so anarchists seek <i>"to eliminate hierarchy  per se, not simply replace one form of hierarchy with another."</i>  [Bookchin, <b>The Ecology of Freedom</b>, p. 27] A hierarchy is a pyramidally-structured organisation composed of a series of grades, ranks, or offices of increasing power, prestige, and (usually) remuneration. Scholars who have investigated the hierarchical form have found that the two primary principles it embodies are domination and exploitation. For example, in his classic article <i>"What Do Bosses Do?"</i>  (<b>Review of Radical Political Economy</b>, Vol. 6, No. 2), a study of the  modern factory,  Steven Marglin found that the main function of the corporate hierarchy  is not greater productive efficiency (as capitalists claim), but greater control over workers, the purpose of such control being more effective exploitation.</p>
<p>Control in a hierarchy is maintained by coercion, that is, by the threat of negative sanctions of one kind or another: physical, economic, psychological, social, etc. Such control, including the repression of  dissent and rebellion, therefore necessitates centralisation: a set  of power relations in which the greatest control is exercised by the  few at the top (particularly the head of the organisation), while those  in the middle ranks have much less control and the many at the bottom  have virtually none.</p>
<p>Since domination, coercion, and centralisation are essential features of authoritarianism, and as those features are embodied in hierarchies, all hierarchical institutions are authoritarian. Moreover,  for anarchists, any organisation marked by hierarchy, centralism and authoritarianism is state-like, or "statist." And as anarchists oppose both the state and authoritarian relations, anyone who does not seek to dismantle <b>all</b> forms of hierarchy cannot be called an anarchist. This applies to capitalist firms. As Noam Chomsky points out, the structure of the capitalist firm is extremely hierarchical, indeed fascist, in  nature:</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>"a fascist system. . . [is] absolutist - power goes from top down . . .  the ideal state is top down control with the public essentially following orders.<br>
</i></p>
<p><i>"Let's take a look at a corporation. . . [I]f you look at what they are, power goes strictly top down, from the board of directors to managers to lower managers to ultimately the people on the shop floor, typing messages, and so on. There's no flow of power or planning from the bottom up. People can disrupt and make suggestions, but the same is true of a slave society. The structure of power is linear, from the top down."</i> [<b>Keeping the Rabble in Line</b>, p. 237]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>David Deleon indicates these similarities between the company and the state well when he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p><i> "Most factories are like military dictatorships. Those at the bottom are privates, the supervisors are sergeants, and on up through the hierarchy. The organisation can dictate everything from our clothing and hair style to how we spend a large portion of our lives, during work. It can compel overtime; it can require us to see a company doctor if we have a medical complaint; it can forbid us free time to engage in political activity; it can suppress freedom of speech, press and assembly -- it can use ID cards and armed security police, along with closed-circuit TVs to watch us; it can punish dissenters with 'disciplinary layoffs' (as GM calls them), or it can fire us. We are forced, by circumstances, to accept much of this, or join the millions of unemployed. . . In almost every job, we have only the 'right' to quit. Major decisions are made at the top and we are expected to obey, whether we work in an ivory tower or a mine shaft."</i> [<i>"For Democracy Where We Work: A rationale for social  self-management"</i>, <b>Reinventing Anarchy, Again</b>,  Howard J. Ehrlich (ed.), pp. 193-4]
</p></blockquote>
<p>Thus the consistent anarchist must oppose hierarchy in all its forms, including the capitalist firm. Not to do so is to support <b><i>archy</i></b> -- which an anarchist, by definition,  cannot do. In other words, for anarchists, <i>"[p]romises to obey,  contracts of (wage)  slavery, agreements requiring the acceptance of a subordinate  status, are all illegitimate because they do restrict and  restrain individual autonomy."</i> [Robert Graham, <i>"The Anarchist  Contract</i>, <b>Reinventing Anarchy, Again</b>, Howard J. Ehrlich  (ed.), p. 77] Hierarchy, therefore, is against the basic principles which drive anarchism. It denies what makes us human and <i>"divest[s] the personality of its most integral traits; it denies the very notion that the individual is <b>competent</b> to deal not only with the management of his or her personal life but with its most  important context: the <b>social</b> context."</i> [Murray Bookchin, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 202]</p>
<p>Some argue that as long as an association is voluntary, whether it has a  hierarchical structure is irrelevant. Anarchists disagree. This is for  two reasons. Firstly, under  capitalism workers are driven by economic necessity to sell their labour (and so liberty) to those who own the means of life. This process re-enforces the economic conditions workers face by creating <i>"massive disparities in wealth . . . [as] workers. . . sell their labour to the  capitalist at a price which does not reflect its real value."</i> Therefore:</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>"To portray the parties to an employment contract,  for example, as free and equal to each other is to ignore the serious inequality of bargaining power which exists between the worker and the employer. To then go on to portray the relationship of subordination and exploitation which naturally results as the epitome of freedom is to make a mockery of both individual liberty and social justice."</i> [Robert Graham, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 70]
</p></blockquote>
<p>It is for this reason that anarchists support collective action and organisation: it increases the bargaining power of working people and allows them to assert their autonomy (see  <a href="secJcon.html">section J</a>).</p>
<p>Secondly, if we take the key element as being whether an association  is voluntary or not we would have to argue that the current state system must be considered as "anarchy." In a modern democracy no  one forces an individual to live in a specific state. We are free  to leave and go somewhere else. By ignoring the hierarchical nature  of an association, you can end up supporting organisations based  upon the denial of freedom (including capitalist companies, the armed forces, states even) all because they are "voluntary." As Bob Black  argues, <i>"[t]o demonise state authoritarianism while ignoring  identical albeit contract-consecrated subservient arrangements  in the large-scale corporations which control the world economy  is fetishism at its worst."</i> [<i>The Libertarian as Conservative,</i> <b>The Abolition of Work and other essays</b>, p. 142]  Anarchy is more than being free to pick a master.</p>
<p>Therefore opposition to hierarchy is a key anarchist position, otherwise you just become a "voluntary archist" - which is hardly anarchistic. For more on this see section A.2.14 (<a href="secA2.html#seca214"> Why is voluntarism not enough?</a>).</p>
<p>Anarchists argue that organisations do not need to be hierarchical, they  can be based upon co-operation between equals who manage their own affairs  directly. In this way we can do without hierarchical structures  (i.e. the delegation of power in the hands of a few). Only when an  association is self-managed by its members can it be considered truly anarchistic.</p>
<p>We are sorry to belabour this point, but some capitalist apologists, apparently wanting to appropriate the "anarchist" name because of its association with freedom, have recently claimed that one can be both a capitalist and an anarchist at the same time (as in so-called "anarcho" capitalism). It should now be clear that since capitalism is based on hierarchy (not to mention statism and exploitation), "anarcho"-capitalism  is a contradiction in terms. (For more on this, see <a href="secFcon.html"> Section F</a>)</p>

<h2>A.2.9 What sort of society do anarchists want?</h2>
<p>Anarchists desire a decentralised society, based on free association. We consider this form of society the best one for maximising the values we have outlined above -- liberty, equality and solidarity. Only by a rational decentralisation of power, both structurally and territorially, can individual liberty be fostered and encouraged. The delegation of power into the hands of a minority is an obvious denial of individual liberty and dignity. Rather than taking the management of their own affairs away from people and putting it in the hands of others, anarchists favour organisations which minimise authority, keeping power at the base, in the hands of those who are affected by any decisions reached.</p>
<p>Free association is the cornerstone of an anarchist society. Individuals must be free to join together as they see fit, for this is the basis of freedom and human dignity. However, any such free agreement must be based on decentralisation of power; otherwise it will be a sham (as in capitalism),  as only equality provides the necessary social context for freedom to grow and development. Therefore anarchists support directly democratic collectives, based on "one person one vote" (for the rationale of direct democracy as the political counterpart of free agreement, see section  A.2.11 -- <a href="secA2.html#seca211"> Why do most anarchists support direct  democracy?</a>).</p>
<p>We should point out here that an anarchist society does not imply some sort of idyllic state of harmony within which everyone agrees. Far from it! As Luigi Galleani points out, <i>"[d]isagreements and friction will  always exist. In fact they are an essential condition of unlimited progress. But once the bloody area of sheer animal competition - the struggle for food - has been eliminated, problems of disagreement could be solved  without the slightest threat to the social order and individual liberty." </i> [<b>The End of Anarchism?</b>, p. 28] Anarchism aims to <i>"rouse the spirit of  initiative in individuals and in groups."</i> These will <i>"create in their mutual relations a movement and a life based on the principles of free understanding"</i> and recognise that <i>"<b>variety, conflict even, is life and that uniformity is death.</b>"</i> [Peter Kropotkin, <b>Anarchism</b>, p. 143]</p>
<p>Therefore, an anarchist society will be based upon co-operative conflict as <i>"[c]onflict, per se, is not harmful. . . disagreements exist [and should not be hidden] . . . What makes disagreement destructive is not the fact of conflict itself but the addition of competition."</i>  Indeed, <i>"a rigid  demand for agreement means that people will effectively be prevented from  contributing their wisdom to a group effort."</i> [Alfie Kohn, <b>No  Contest: The Case Against Competition</b>, p. 156] It is  for this reason that most anarchists reject consensus decision making in  large groups (see section <a href="secA2.html#seca212">A.2.12</a>).</p>
<p>So, in an anarchist society associations would be run by mass assemblies of  all involved, based upon extensive discussion, debate and co-operative  conflict between equals, with purely administrative tasks being handled by  elected committees. These committees would be made up of mandated, recallable  and temporary delegates who carry out their tasks under the watchful eyes of the assembly which elected them. Thus in an anarchist society,  <i>"we'll look after our affairs ourselves and decide what to do about them. And when, to put our ideas into action, there is a need to put someone in charge of a project, we'll tell them to do [it] in such and such a way and no other . . .  nothing would be done without our decision. So our delegates, instead of people being individuals whom we've given the right to order us about, would be people . . . [with] no authority, only the duty to carry out what everyone involved wanted."</i> [Errico Malatesta, <b>Fra Contadini</b>, p. 34] If the delegates act against their mandate  or try to extend their influence or work beyond that already decided by the  assembly (i.e. if they start to make policy decisions), they can be instantly  recalled and their decisions abolished. In this way, the organisation remains  in the hands of the union of individuals who created it.</p>
<p>This self-management by the members of a group at the base and the power  of recall are essential tenets of any anarchist organisation.  The <b>key</b> difference between a statist or hierarchical system and an  anarchist community is who wields power. In a parliamentary system, for  example, people give power to a group of representatives to make decisions for  them for a fixed period of time. Whether they carry out their promises  is irrelevant as people cannot recall them till the next election. Power  lies at the top and those at the base are expected to obey. Similarly,  in the capitalist workplace, power is held by an unelected minority of  bosses and managers at the top and the workers are expected to obey.</p>
<p>In an anarchist society this  relationship is reversed. No one individual or group (elected or unelected)  holds power in an anarchist community. Instead decisions are made using direct  democratic principles and, when required, the community can elect or appoint  delegates to carry out these decisions.  There is a clear distinction between  policy making (which lies with everyone who is affected) and the co-ordination  and administration of any adopted policy (which is the job for delegates).</p>
<p>These egalitarian communities, founded by free agreement, also freely associate together in confederations. Such a free confederation would be run from the bottom up, with decisions following from the elemental assemblies upwards. The confederations would be run in the same manner as the collectives. There would be regular local regional, "national" and  international conferences in which all important issues and problems  affecting the collectives involved would be discussed. In addition,  the fundamental, guiding principles and ideas of society would be debated and policy decisions made, put into practice, reviewed,  and co-ordinated. The delegates would simply <i>"take their given mandates to the relative meetings and try to harmonise their various needs and desires. The deliberations would always be subject to the control and approval of those who delegated them"</i> and so <i>"there would be no danger than the interest of the people [would] be forgotten."</i> [Malatesta, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 36]</p>
<p>Action committees would be formed, if required, to co-ordinate and  administer the decisions of the assemblies and their congresses, under  strict control from below as discussed above. Delegates to such bodies   would have a limited tenure and, like the delegates to the congresses, have a fixed mandate -- they are not able  to make decisions on behalf  of the people they are delegates for. In addition, like the delegates  to conferences and congresses, they would be subject to instant recall  by the assemblies and congresses from which they emerged in the first  place. In this way any committees required to co-ordinate join activities would be, to quote Malatesta's words, <i>"always under the direct control of the population"</i> and so express the  <i>"decisions taken at popular assemblies."</i> [<b>Errico Malatesta: His Life and Ideas</b>, p. 175 and p. 129]</p>
<p>Most importantly, the basic community assemblies can overturn any decisions  reached by the conferences and withdraw from any confederation. Any  compromises that are made by a delegate during negotiations have to go  back to a general assembly for ratification. Without that ratification  any compromises that are made by a delegate are not binding on the  community that has delegated a particular task to a particular  individual or committee. In addition,  they can call confederal conferences to discuss new developments and to  inform action committees about changing wishes and to instruct them on  what to do about any developments and ideas.</p>
<p>In other words, any delegates required within an anarchist organisation  or society are <b>not</b> representatives (as they are in a democratic  government). Kropotkin makes the difference clear:</p>
<blockquote><p><i> "The question of true delegation versus representation can be better understood if one imagines a hundred or two hundred men [and women], who meet each day in their work and share common concerns . . . who have discussed every aspect of the question that concerns them and have reached a decision. They then choose someone and send him [or her] to reach an agreement with other delegates of the same kind. . .  The delegate is not authorised to do more than explain to other delegates the considerations that have led his [or her] colleagues to their conclusion. Not being able to impose anything, he [or she] will seek an understanding and will return with a simple proposition which his mandatories can accept or refuse. This is what happens when true delegation comes into being."</i> [<b>Words of a  Rebel</b>, p. 132]
</p></blockquote>
<p>Unlike in a representative system, <b>power</b> is not delegated into the hands of the few. Rather, any delegate is simply a mouthpiece for the association that elected (or otherwise selected) them in the first place. All delegates and action committees would be mandated and subject to instant recall to ensure they express the wishes of  the assemblies they came from rather than their own. In this way  government is replaced by anarchy, a network of free associations  and communities co-operating as equals based on a system of mandated  delegates, instant recall, free agreement and free federation from  the bottom up.</p>
<p>Only this system would ensure the <i>"free organisation of the people,  an organisation from below upwards."</i> This <i>"free federation from below upward"</i> would start with the basic <i>"association"</i> and their federation <i>"first into a commune, then a federation of communes  into regions, of regions into nations, and of nations into an  international fraternal association."</i> [Michael Bakunin, <b>The Political Philosophy of Bakunin</b>, p. 298] This network of anarchist communities would work on three levels. There would be <i>"independent Communes for the territorial organisation, and of federations of Trade Unions [i.e. workplace associations] for the  organisation of men [and women] in accordance with their different functions. . . [and] free combines and societies . . . for the satisfaction of all possible and imaginable needs, economic, sanitary, and educational; for mutual protection, for the propaganda of ideas, for arts, for amusement, and so on."</i> [Peter Kropotkin, <b>Evolution and Environment</b>, p. 79] All would be based on self-management, free association, free federation and self-organisation from the bottom up.</p>
<p>By organising in this manner, hierarchy is abolished in all aspects of life, because the people at the base of the organisation are in control, <b>not</b> their delegates.  Only this form of organisation can replace government (the initiative and empowerment of the few) with anarchy (the initiative and empowerment of all). This form of organisation would exist in all activities which required group work and the co-ordination of many people. It would be, as Bakunin said, the means <i>"to integrate individuals into structures which  they could understand and control."</i> [quoted by Cornelius Castoriadis, <b>Political and Social Writings</b>, vol. 2, p. 97] For individual initiatives, the individual involved would manage them.</p>
<p>As can be seen, anarchists wish to create a society based upon structures  that ensure that no individual or group is able to wield power over others.  Free agreement, confederation and the power of recall, fixed mandates and  limited tenure are mechanisms by which power is removed from the hands of  governments and placed in the hands of those directly affected by the  decisions.</p>
<p>For a fuller discussion on what an anarchist society would look like see <a href="secIcon.html">section I</a>. Anarchy,  however, is not some distant goal but rather  an aspect of current struggles against oppression and exploitation.  Means and ends are linked, with direct action generating mass  participatory organisations and preparing people to directly manage  their own personal and collective interests. This is because anarchists,  as we discuss in <a href="secI2.html#seci23">section I.2.3</a>, see the framework of a free society  being based on the organisations created by the oppressed in their  struggle against capitalism in the here and now. In this sense, collective struggle creates the organisations as well as the individual  attitudes anarchism needs to work. The struggle against oppression is  the school of anarchy. It teaches us not only how to be anarchists but  also gives us a glimpse of what an anarchist society would be like,  what its initial organisational framework could be and the experience  of managing our own activities which is required for such a society to  work. As such, anarchists try to create the kind of world we want in our current struggles and do not think our ideas are only applicable "after the revolution." Indeed, by applying our principles today we bring anarchy that much nearer.</p>

<h2>A.2.10 What will abolishing hierarchy mean and achieve?</h2>
<p>The creation of a new society based upon libertarian organisations will have an incalculable effect on everyday life. The empowerment of millions of people will transform society in ways we can only guess at now.</p>
<p>However, many consider these forms of organisation as impractical and doomed to failure. To those who say that such confederal, non-authoritarian organisations would produce confusion and disunity, anarchists maintain that the statist, centralised and hierarchical form of organisation produces indifference instead of involvement, heartlessness instead of solidarity, uniformity instead of unity, and privileged elites instead of equality.  More importantly, such organisations destroy individual initiative and crush independent action and critical thinking. (For more on hierarchy, see section B.1 -- <a href="secB1.html">"Why are anarchists against authority and hierarchy?"</a>).</p>
<p>That libertarian organisation can work and is based upon (and promotes) liberty was demonstrated in the Spanish Anarchist movement. Fenner Brockway, Secretary of the British Independent Labour Party, when visiting Barcelona during the 1936 revolution, noted that <i>"the great solidarity that existed among the Anarchists was due to each individual relying on his [sic]  own strength and not depending upon leadership. . . . The organisations  must, to be successful, be combined with free-thinking people; not a  mass, but free individuals"</i> [quoted by Rudolf Rocker, <b>Anarcho-syndicalism</b>, p. 67f]</p>
<p>As sufficiently indicated already, hierarchical, centralised structures restrict freedom. As Proudhon noted: <i>"the centralist system is all  very well as regards size, simplicity and construction: it lacks but one  thing -- the individual no longer belongs to himself in such a system, he  cannot feel his worth, his life, and no account is taken of him at all."</i> [quoted by Martin Buber, <b>Paths in Utopia</b>, p. 33]</p>
<p>The effects of hierarchy can be seen all around us. It does not work.  Hierarchy and authority exist everywhere, in the workplace, at home, in  the street. As Bob Black puts it, <i>"[i]f you spend most of your waking life taking orders or kissing ass, if you get habituated to hierarchy, you will  become passive-aggressive, sado-masochistic, servile and stupefied, and  you will carry that load into every aspect of the balance of your life."</i> [<i>"The Libertarian as Conservative,"</i> <b>The Abolition of Work and other essays</b>, pp. 147-8]</p>
<p>This means that the end of hierarchy will mean a <b>massive</b> transformation in everyday life. It will involve the creation of individual-centred organisations within which all can exercise, and so develop, their  abilities to the fullest. By involving themselves and participating  in the decisions that affect them, their workplace, their community and society, they can ensure the full development of their individual  capacities.</p>
<p>With the free participation of all in social life, we would quickly see the end of inequality and injustice. Rather than people existing to make ends meet and being used to increase the wealth and power of the few as under capitalism, the end of hierarchy would see (to quote Kropotkin) <i>"the well-being of all"</i> and it is <i>"high time for the worker to assert his [or her] right to the common inheritance, and to enter into possession of it."</i> [<b>The Conquest of Bread</b>, p. 35 and p. 44] For only taking possession of the means of life (workplaces,  housing, the land, etc.) can ensure <i>"liberty and justice, for liberty and justice are not decreed but are the result of economic  independence. They spring from the fact that the individual is able to live without depending on a master, and to enjoy . . . the product of his [or her] toil."</i> [Ricardo Flores Magon, <b>Land and Liberty</b>, p. 62] Therefore liberty requires the abolition of  capitalist private property rights in favour of <b><i>"use rights."</i></b>  (see <a href="secB3.html">section B.3</a> for more details). Ironically, the <i>"abolition of  property will free the people from homelessness and nonpossession."</i> [Max Baginski, <i>"Without Government,"</i> <b>Anarchy! An Anthology of  Emma Goldman's Mother Earth</b>, p. 11] Thus anarchism promises <i>"both requisites of happiness -- liberty and wealth."</i> In anarchy, <i>"mankind will live in freedom and in comfort."</i> [Benjamin Tucker, <b>Why  I am an Anarchist</b>, p. 135 and p. 136]</p>
<p>Only self-determination and free agreement on every level of society can develop the responsibility, initiative, intellect and solidarity of individuals and society as a whole. Only anarchist organisation allows the vast talent which exists within humanity to be accessed and used, enriching society by the very process of enriching and developing the individual. Only by involving everyone in the process of thinking, planning, co-ordinating and implementing the decisions that affect them can freedom blossom and individuality be fully developed and protected. Anarchy will release the creativity and talent of the mass of people enslaved by hierarchy.</p>
<p>Anarchy will even be of benefit for those who are said to benefit from capitalism and its authority relations. Anarchists <i>"maintain that <b>both</b> rulers and ruled are spoiled by authority; <b>both</b> exploiters and exploited are spoiled by exploitation."</i> [Peter Kropotkin, <b>Act for Yourselves</b>,  p. 83] This is because <i>"[i]n any hierarchical relationship the dominator as well as the submissive pays his dues. The price paid for the 'glory of  command' is indeed heavy. Every tyrant resents his duties. He is relegated  to drag the dead weight of the dormant creative potential of the  submissive all along the road of his hierarchical excursion."</i>  [For Ourselves, <b>The Right to Be Greedy</b>, Thesis 95]</p>
<p><a name="seca211"></a></p>
<h2>A.2.11 Why are most anarchists in favour of direct democracy?</h2>
<p>For most anarchists, direct democratic voting on policy decisions  within free associations is the political counterpart of free  agreement (this is also known as <b><i>"self-management"</i></b>). The reason  is that <i>"many forms of domination can be carried out in a 'free.'  non-coercive, contractual manner. . . and it is naive. . . to think  that mere opposition to political control will in itself lead to an  end of oppression."</i> [John P. Clark, <b>Max Stirner's Egoism</b>, p. 93]  Thus the relationships we create <b>within</b> an organisation is as important in determining its libertarian nature as its voluntary nature (see <a href="secA2.html#seca214">section A.2.14</a>  for more discussion).</p>
<p>It is obvious that individuals must work together in order to lead a fully human life. And so, <i>"[h]aving to join with others humans"</i> the individual has three options: <i>"he [or she] must submit to the will of others (be enslaved) or subject others to his will (be in authority) or live with others in fraternal agreement in the interests of the greatest good of all (be an associate). Nobody can escape from this necessity."</i> [Errico Malatesta, <b>Life and Ideas</b>, p. 85]</p>
<p>Anarchists obviously pick the last option, association, as the only means  by which individuals can work together as free and equal human beings,  respecting the uniqueness and liberty of one another. Only within direct democracy can individuals express themselves, practice critical thought and  self-government, so developing their intellectual and ethical capacities  to the full. In terms of increasing an individual's freedom and their  intellectual, ethical and social faculties, it is far better to be sometimes  in a minority than be subject to the will of a boss all the time. So what  is the theory behind anarchist direct democracy?</p>
<p>As Bertrand Russell noted, the anarchist <i>"does not wish to abolish  government in the sense of collective decisions: what he does wish  to abolish is the system by which a decision is enforced upon those  who oppose it."</i> [<b>Roads to Freedom</b>, p. 85] Anarchists see  self-management as the means to achieve this. Once an individual  joins a community or workplace, he or she becomes  a "citizen" (for want of a better word) of that association. The association  is organised around an assembly of all its members (in the case of large  workplaces and towns, this may be a functional sub-group such as a specific  office or neighbourhood). In this assembly, in concert with others, the contents  of his or her political obligations are defined. In acting within the  association, people must exercise critical judgement and choice, i.e. manage  their own activity. Rather than promising to obey (as in hierarchical  organisations like the state or capitalist firm), individuals  participate in making their own collective decisions, their own commitments to their fellows. This means that political obligation is not owed to a  separate entity above the group or society, such as the state or company, but  to one's fellow "citizens."</p>
<p>Although the assembled people collectively legislate the rules governing their association, and are bound by them as individuals, they are also superior to them in the sense that these rules can always be modified or repealed. Collectively, the associated "citizens" constitute a political "authority", but as this "authority" is based on horizontal relationships between themselves rather than vertical ones between themselves and an elite, the "authority" is non-hierarchical ("rational" or "natural," see section B.1 - <a href="secB1.html">"Why are anarchists against authority and hierarchy?"</a> - for more on this). Thus Proudhon:</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>"In place of laws, we will put contracts [i.e. free agreement]. - No  more laws voted by a majority, nor even unanimously; each citizen,  each town, each industrial union, makes its own laws."</i> [<b>The General Idea of the Revolution</b>, pp. 245-6]
</p></blockquote>
<p>Such a system does not mean, of course, that everyone participates in every decision needed, no matter how trivial. While any decision  can be put to the assembly (if the assembly so decides, perhaps  prompted by some of its members), in practice certain activities  (and so purely functional decisions) will be handled by the  association's elected administration. This is because, to quote a Spanish anarchist activist, <i>"a collectivity as such cannot write a letter or add up a list of figures or do hundreds of chores which only an individual can perform."</i> Thus the need <i>"to <b>organise the administration.</b>"</i> Supposing an association is <i>"organised without  any directive council or any hierarchical offices"</i> which <i>"meets in general assembly once a week or more often, when it settles all matters needful for its progress"</i> it still <i>"nominates a commission with <b>strictly administrative functions.</b>"</i> However, the assembly <i>"prescribes a definite line of conduct for this  commission or gives it an <b>imperative mandate</b>"</i> and so <i>"would be <b>perfectly anarchist.</b>"</i> As it <i>"follows that <b>delegating</b>  these tasks to qualified individuals, who are <b>instructed in advance how to proceed,</b> . . . does not mean an abdication of that collectivity's own liberty."</i> [Jose Llunas Pujols, quoted by Max Nettlau, <b>A Short History of Anarchism</b>, p. 187] This, it should be noted, follows Proudhon's ideas that within the workers' associations  <i>"all positions are elective, and the by-laws subject to the  approval of the members."</i> [Proudhon, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 222]</p>
<p>Instead of capitalist or statist hierarchy, self-management (i.e.  direct democracy) would be the guiding principle of the freely  joined associations that make up a free society. This would apply to the federations of associations an anarchist society would need to function. <i>"All the commissions or delegations nominated in an anarchist society,"</i> correctly argued Jose Llunas Pujols, <i>"must be subject to replacement and recall at any time by the permanent suffrage of the section or sections that elected them."</i> Combined with the <i>"imperative mandate"</i> and <i>"purely administrative functions,"</i> this <i>"make[s] it thereby impossible for anyone to arrogate to himself [or herself] a scintilla of authority."</i> [quoted by Max Nettlau, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, pp. 188-9] Again, Pujols follows Proudhon who demanded twenty years previously the <i>"implementation of the binding mandate"</i> to ensure the people do not <i>"adjure  their sovereignty."</i> [<b>No Gods, No Masters</b>, vol. 1, p. 63]</p>
<p>By means of a federalism based on mandates and elections, anarchists  ensure that decisions flow from the bottom-up. By making our own decisions, by looking after our joint interests ourselves, we exclude  others ruling over us. Self-management, for anarchists, is essential to ensure freedom within the organisations so needed for any decent  human existence.</p>
<p>Of course it could be argued that if you are in a minority, you are governed by others (<i>"Democratic rule is still rule"</i> [L. Susan Brown,  <b>The Politics of Individualism</b>, p. 53]). Now, the concept of  direct democracy as we have described it is not necessarily tied to the concept of majority rule. If someone finds themselves in a minority on a particular vote, he or she is confronted with the choice of either consenting or refusing to recognise it as binding. To deny the minority the opportunity to exercise its judgement and choice is to infringe its autonomy and to impose obligation upon it which it has not freely accepted. The coercive imposition of the majority will is contrary to the ideal of self-assumed obligation, and so is contrary to direct democracy and free association. Therefore, far from being a denial of freedom, direct democracy within the context of free association and self-assumed obligation is the only means by which liberty can be nurtured (<i>"Individual autonomy limited by the  obligation to hold given promises."</i> [Malatesta, quoted by quoted by Max  Nettlau, <b>Errico Malatesta: The Biography of an Anarchist</b>]).  Needless to say, a minority, if it remains in the association, can argue its case and try to convince the majority of  the error of its ways.</p>
<p>And we must point out here that anarchist support for direct democracy does  not suggest we think that the majority is always right. Far from it! The case  for democratic participation is not that the majority is always right, but  that no minority can be trusted not to prefer its own advantage to the good of the whole. History proves what common-sense predicts, namely that anyone with dictatorial powers (by they a head of state, a boss, a husband, whatever) will use their power to enrich and empower themselves at the expense of those subject to their decisions.</p>
<p>Anarchists recognise that majorities can and do make mistakes and that is why our theories on association place great importance on minority rights. This can be seen from our theory of self-assumed obligation, which bases itself on the right of minorities to protest against majority decisions and makes dissent a key factor in decision making. Thus Carole Pateman:</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>"If the majority have acted in bad faith. . . [then the] minority will  have to take political action, including politically disobedient action if appropriate, to defend their citizenship and independence, and the political association itself. . . Political disobedience is merely one possible expression of the active citizenship on which a self-managing democracy is based . . . The social practice of promising involves the right to refuse or change commitments; similarly, the practice of self-assumed political obligation is meaningless without the practical recognition of the right of minorities to refuse or withdraw consent, or where necessary, to disobey."</i> [<b>The Problem of Political  Obligation</b>, p. 162]
</p></blockquote>
<p>Moving beyond relationships within associations, we must highlight how different associations work together. As would be imagined, the links between  associations follow the same outlines as for the associations themselves.  Instead of individuals joining an association, we have associations joining confederations. The links between associations in the confederation  are of the same horizontal and voluntary nature as within associations, with  the same rights of "voice and exit" for members and the same rights for minorities. In this way society becomes an association of associations, a community of communities, a commune of communes, based upon maximising  individual freedom by maximising participation and self-management.</p>
<p>The workings of such a confederation are outlined in section A.2.9  (<a href="secA2.html#seca29"> What sort of society do anarchists want?</a>)  and discussed in greater detail in section I (<a href="secIcon.html">What  would an anarchist society look like?</a>).</p>
<p>This system of direct democracy fits nicely into anarchist theory. Malatesta  speaks for all anarchists when he argued that <i>"anarchists deny the right of the majority to govern human society in general."</i> As can  be seen, the majority has no right to enforce itself on a minority -- the  minority can leave the association at any time and so, to use Malatesta's  words, do not have to <i>"submit to the decisions of the majority before they  have even heard what these might be."</i> [<b>The Anarchist Revolution</b>,  p. 100 and p. 101] Hence, direct  democracy within voluntary association does not create "majority rule"  nor assume that the minority must submit to the majority no matter what. In effect, anarchist supporters of direct democracy argue that it fits Malatesta's argument that:</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>"Certainly anarchists recognise that where life is lived in common it is often necessary for the minority to come to accept the opinion of the majority. When there is an obvious need or usefulness in doing something and, to do it requires the agreement of all, the few should feel the need to adapt to the wishes of the many . . . But such adaptation on the one hand by one group must be on the other be reciprocal,  voluntary and must stem from an awareness of need and of goodwill to prevent the running of social affairs from being paralysed by obstinacy. It cannot be imposed as a principle and statutory norm. . ."</i> [<b>Op.  Cit.</b>, p. 100]
</p></blockquote>
<p>As the minority has the right to secede from the association as well as having extensive rights of action, protest and appeal, majority rule  is not imposed as a principle. Rather, it is purely a decision making tool which allows minority dissent and opinion to be expressed (and acted upon) while ensuring that no minority forces its will on the majority. In other words, majority decisions are not binding on the minority. After all, as Malatesta argued:</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>"one cannot expect, or even wish, that someone who is firmly convinced that the course taken by the majority leads to disaster, should sacrifice his [or her] own convictions and passively look on, or even worse, should support a policy he [or she] considers wrong."</i> [<b>Errico Malatesta: His  Life and Ideas</b>, p. 132]
</p></blockquote>
<p>Even the Individual Anarchist Lysander Spooner acknowledged that direct  democracy has its uses when he noted that <i>"[a]ll, or nearly all, voluntary  associations give a majority, or some other portion of the members less  than the whole, the right to use some <b>limited</b> discretion as to the  <b>means</b> to be used to accomplish the ends in view."</i> However, only the  unanimous decision of a jury (which would <i>"judge the law, and the justice  of the law"</i>) could determine individual rights as this <i>"tribunal fairly  represent[s] the whole people"</i> as <i>"no law can rightfully be enforced by the association in its corporate capacity, against the goods, rights, or person of any individual, except it be such as <b>all</b> members of the association agree that it may enforce"</i> (his support of juries results from Spooner acknowledging that it <i>"would be impossible in practice"</i> for <b>all</b> members of an association to agree) [<b>Trial by Jury</b>, p. 130-1f, p. 134, p. 214, p. 152 and p. 132]</p>
<p>Thus direct democracy and individual/minority rights need not clash.  In practice, we can imagine direct democracy would be used to make most decisions within most associations (perhaps with super-majorities required for fundamental decisions) plus some combination of a jury system and  minority protest/direct action and evaluate/protect minority claims/rights  in an anarchist society. The actual forms of freedom can only be created through practical experience by the people directly involved.</p>
<p>Lastly, we must stress that anarchist support for direct democracy does not mean that this solution is to be favoured in all circumstances. For example, many small associations may favour consensus decision making  (see the <a href="secA2.html#seca212">next section</a> on consensus and  why most anarchists do not think  that it is a viable alternative to direct democracy). However, most  anarchists think that direct democracy within free association is the  best (and most realistic) form of organisation which is consistent with  anarchist principles of individual freedom, dignity and equality.</p>
<p><a name="seca212"></a></p>
<h2>A.2.12 Is consensus an alternative to direct democracy?</h2>
<p>The few anarchists who reject direct democracy within free associations generally support consensus in decision making. Consensus is based upon everyone on a group agreeing to a decision before it can be put into action. Thus, it is argued, consensus stops the majority ruling  the minority and is more consistent with anarchist principles.</p>
<p>Consensus, although the "best" option in decision making, as all agree, has its problems. As Murray Bookchin points out in describing his experience of consensus, it can have authoritarian implications:</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>"In order. . . to create full consensus on a decision, minority  dissenters were often subtly urged or psychologically coerced to decline  to vote on a troubling issue, inasmuch as their dissent would essentially  amount to a one-person veto. This practice, called 'standing aside' in  American consensus processes, all too often involved intimidation of the  dissenters, to the point that they completely withdrew from the  decision-making process, rather than make an honourable and continuing  expression of their dissent by voting, even as a minority, in accordance  with their views. Having withdrawn, they ceased to be political beings--so  that a 'decision' could be made. . . . 'consensus' was ultimately achieved only after dissenting members nullified themselves as  participants in the process.<br>
</i></p>
<p><i>"On a more theoretical level, consensus silenced that most vital aspect of  all dialogue, <b>dissensus</b>. The ongoing dissent, the passionate dialogue that  still persists even after a minority accedes temporarily to a majority  decision,. . . [can be] replaced. . . .by dull monologues -- and the uncontroverted and deadening tone of consensus. In majority decision-making,  the defeated minority can resolve to overturn a decision on which they have  been defeated -- they are free to openly and persistently articulate reasoned  and potentially persuasive disagreements. Consensus, for its part, honours  no minorities, but mutes them in favour of the metaphysical  'one'  of the  'consensus' group."</i> [<i>"Communalism: The Democratic Dimension of Anarchism"</i>, <b>Democracy and Nature</b>, no. 8, p. 8]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bookchin does not <i>"deny that consensus may be an appropriate form of  decision-making in small groups of people who are thoroughly familiar with  one another." </i>But he notes that, in practical terms, his own experience has shown him that <i>"when larger groups try to make decisions by consensus, it usually obliges them to arrive at the lowest common  intellectual denominator in their decision-making: the least  controversial or even the most mediocre decision that a sizeable assembly of people can attain is adopted-- precisely because everyone must agree with it or else withdraw from voting on that issue"</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, p.7]</p>
<p>Therefore, due to its potentially authoritarian nature, most anarchists  disagree that consensus is the political aspect of free association. While it is advantageous to try to reach consensus, it is usually impractical to do so -- especially in large groups -- regardless of its other, negative effects. Often it demeans a free society or association  by tending to subvert individuality in the name of community and dissent in the name of solidarity. Neither true community nor solidarity are fostered when the individual's development and self-expression are aborted by public disapproval and pressure. Since individuals are all unique, they will have unique viewpoints which they should be encouraged to express, as society evolves and is enriched by the actions and ideas of individuals.</p>
<p>In other words, anarchist supporters of direct democracy stress the  <i>"<b>creative</b> role of dissent"</i> which, they fear, <i>"tends  to fade away in the grey uniformity required by consensus."</i>  [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 8]</p>
<p>We must stress that anarchists are <b>not</b> in favour of a mechanical  decision making process in which the majority just vote the minority away  and ignore them. Far from it! Anarchists who support direct democracy see it as a dynamic debating process in which majority and minority listen to and respect each other as far possible and create a decision which all can live with (if possible). They see the process of participation  within directly democratic associations as the means of creating common  interests, as a process which will encourage diversity, individual and minority expression and reduce any tendency for majorities to marginalise  or oppress minorities by ensuring discussion and debate occurs on important  issues.</p>

<h2>A.2.13 Are anarchists individualists or collectivists?</h2>
<p>The short answer is: neither. This can be seen from the fact that liberal scholars denounce anarchists like Bakunin for being "collectivists" while Marxists attack Bakunin and anarchists in general for being "individualists."</p>
<p>This is hardly surprising, as anarchists reject both ideologies as nonsense. Whether they like it or not, non-anarchist individualists and collectivists are two sides of the same capitalist coin. This can best shown be by considering modern capitalism, in which "individualist" and "collectivist" tendencies continually interact, often with the political and economic structure swinging from one pole to the other. Capitalist collectivism and individualism are both one-sided aspects of human existence, and like all manifestations of imbalance, deeply flawed.</p>
<p>For anarchists, the idea that individuals should sacrifice themselves for the "group" or "greater good" is nonsensical. Groups are made up of individuals, and if people think only of what's best for the group, the group will be a lifeless shell. It is only the dynamics of human interaction within groups which give them life. "Groups" cannot think, only individuals can. This fact, ironically, leads authoritarian "collectivists" to a most particular kind of "individualism," namely the <i>"cult of the personality" </i>and leader worship. This is to be expected, since such collectivism lumps individuals into abstract groups, denies their individuality, and ends up with the need for someone with enough individuality to make decisions -- a problem that is "solved" by the leader principle. Stalinism and Nazism are excellent examples of this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Therefore, anarchists recognise that individuals are the basic unit of society and that only individuals have interests and feelings. This  means they oppose "collectivism" and the glorification of the group. In anarchist theory the group exists only to aid and develop the individuals involved in them. This is why we place so much stress  on groups structured in a libertarian manner -- only a libertarian  organisation allows the individuals within a group to fully express themselves, manage their own interests directly and to create social relationships which encourage individuality and individual freedom. So while society and the groups they join shapes the individual, the individual is the true basis of society. Hence Malatesta:</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>"Much has been said about the respective roles of individual initiative and social action in the life and progress of human societies . . .  [E]verything is maintained and kept going in the human world thanks to individual initiative . . . The real being is man, the individual. Society or the collectivity - and the <b>State</b> or government which claims  to represent it - if it is not a hollow abstraction, must be made up of individuals. And it is in the organism of every individual that all  thoughts and human actions inevitably have their origin, and from being individual they become collective thoughts and acts when they are or become accepted by many individuals. Social action, therefore, is neither the negation nor the complement of individual initiatives, but is the  resultant of initiatives, thoughts and actions of all individuals who make up society . . . [T]he question is not really changing the  relationship between society and the individual . . . [I]t is a question of preventing some individuals from oppressing others; of giving all individuals the same rights and the same means of action; and of replacing the initiative to the few [which Malatesta defines as a key aspect of government/hierarchy], which inevitably results in the oppression of everyone else . . . "</i> [<b>Anarchy</b>, pp. 38-38]
</p></blockquote>
<p>These considerations do not mean that "individualism" finds favour with anarchists. As Emma Goldman pointed out, <i>"'rugged individualism'. . .   is only a masked attempt to repress and defeat the individual and his  individuality. So-called Individualism is the social and economic <b>laissez-faire</b>: the exploitation of the masses by the [ruling] classes by means of legal trickery, spiritual debasement and  systematic indoctrination of the servile spirit . . . That corrupt  and perverse 'individualism' is the straitjacket of individuality  . . [It] has inevitably resulted in the greatest modern slavery, the crassest class distinctions driving millions to the breadline. 'Rugged individualism' has meant all the 'individualism' for the  masters, while the people are regimented into a slave caste to serve  a handful of self-seeking 'supermen.'"</i> [<b>Red Emma Speaks</b>, p. 112]</p>
<p>While groups cannot think, individuals cannot live or discuss by  themselves. Groups and associations are an essential aspect of  individual life. Indeed, as groups generate social relationships  by their very nature, they help <b>shape</b> individuals. In other words,  groups structured in an authoritarian way will have a negative impact  on the freedom and individuality of those within them. However, due to the abstract nature of their "individualism," capitalist individualists  fail to see any difference between groups structured in a libertarian  manner rather than in an authoritarian one -- they are both "groups".  Because of their one-sided perspective on this issue, "individualists"  ironically end up supporting some of the most "collectivist" institutions  in existence -- capitalist companies -- and, moreover, always find a  need for the state despite their frequent denunciations of it. These  contradictions stem from capitalist individualism's dependence on  individual contracts in an unequal society, i.e. <b>abstract</b> individualism.</p>
<p>In contrast, anarchists stress <b>social</b> "individualism" (another, perhaps better, term for this concept could be <b><i>"communal individuality"</i></b>).  Anarchism <i>"insists that the centre of gravity in society is the  individual -- that he [sic] must think for himself, act freely, and live fully. . . . If he  is to develop freely and fully, he must be relieved from the interference  and oppression of others. . . . [T]his has nothing in common with. . .  'rugged individualism.' Such predatory individualism is really flabby,  not rugged. At the least danger to its safety, it runs to cover of the  state and wails for protection. . . .Their 'rugged individualism' is  simply one of the many pretences the ruling class makes to mask unbridled business and political extortion."</i> [Emma Goldman, <b>Op. Cit.</b>,  pp. 442-3]</p>
<p>Anarchism rejects the <b>abstract</b> individualism of capitalism, with its  ideas of "absolute" freedom of the individual which is constrained by  others. This theory ignores the social context in which freedom exists  and grows. <i>"The freedom we want,"</i> Malatesta argued, <i>"for ourselves and for others, is not an absolute metaphysical, abstract freedom  which in practice is inevitably translated into the oppression of the weak; but it is a real freedom, possible freedom, which is the  conscious community of interests, voluntary solidarity."</i> [<b>Anarchy</b>, p. 43]</p>
<p>A society based on abstract individualism results in an inequality of power between the contracting individuals and so entails the need for  an authority based on laws above them and organised coercion to enforce the  contracts between them. This consequence is evident from capitalism and, most notably, in the "social contract" theory of how the state developed. In this theory it is assumed that individuals are "free" when they are  isolated from each other, as they allegedly were originally in the  "state of nature." Once they join society, they supposedly create a  "contract" and a state to administer it. However, besides being a fantasy with no basis in reality (human beings have <b>always</b> been social  animals), this "theory" is actually a justification for the state's having extensive  powers over society; and this in turn is a justification of the capitalist  system, which requires a strong state. It also mimics the results of the  capitalist economic relations upon which this theory is built. Within  capitalism, individuals "freely" contract together, but in practice the  owner rules the worker for as long as the contract is in place. (See  sections <a href="secA2.html#seca214">A.2.14</a> and  <a href="secB4.html">B.4</a> for further details).</p>
<p>Thus anarchists reject capitalist "individualism" as being, to quote Kropotkin, <i>"a narrow and selfish individualism"</i> which, moreover, is <i>"a foolish egoism which belittles the individual"</i> and is <i>"not individualism at all. It will not lead to what was established as a goal; that is the complete broad and most  perfectly attainable development of individuality."</i> The hierarchy of capitalism results in <i>"the impoverishment of individuality"</i> rather than its development. To this anarchists contrast <i>"the individuality  which attains the greatest individual development possible through the highest communist sociability in what concerns both its primordial needs and its relationships with others in general."</i> [<b>Selected Writings on Anarchism and Revolution</b>, p. 295, p. 296 and p. 297] For anarchists, our freedom is enriched  by those around us when we work with them as equals and not as master and servant.</p>
<p>In practice, both individualism and collectivism lead to a denial of both individual liberty and group autonomy and dynamics. In addition, each implies the other, with collectivism leading to a particular form of individualism and individualism leading to a particular form of collectivism.</p>
<p>Collectivism, with its implicit suppression of the individual, ultimately impoverishes the community, as groups are only given life by the individuals who comprise them. Individualism, with its explicit suppression of community (i.e. the people with whom you live), ultimately impoverishes the individual, since individuals do not exist apart from society but can only exist within it. In addition, individualism  ends up denying the "select few" the insights and abilities of the  individuals who make up the rest of society, and so is a source of self-denial. This is Individualism's fatal flaw (and contradiction),  namely <i>"the impossibility for the individual to attain a really full development in the conditions of oppression of the mass by the 'beautiful aristocracies'. His [or her] development would remain uni-lateral."</i> [Peter Kropotkin, <b>Anarchism</b>, p. 293]</p>
<p>True liberty and community exist elsewhere.</p>
<p><a name="seca214"></a></p>
<h2>A.2.14 Why is voluntarism not enough?</h2>
<p>Voluntarism means that association should be voluntary in order maximise  liberty. Anarchists are, obviously, voluntarists, thinking that only in free association, created by free agreement, can individuals develop, grow, and express their liberty. However, it is evident that under capitalism voluntarism is not enough in itself to maximise liberty.</p>
<p>Voluntarism implies promising (i.e. the freedom to make agreements), and promising implies that individuals are capable of independent judgement and rational deliberation. In addition, it presupposes that they can evaluate and change their actions and relationships. Contracts under capitalism, however, contradict these implications of voluntarism. For, while technically "voluntary" (though as we show in  <a href="secB4.html">section B.4,</a> this is not really the case), capitalist contracts result in a denial of liberty.  This is because the social relationship of wage-labour involves promising to obey in return for payment. And as Carole Pateman points out, <i>"to promise  to obey is to deny or to limit, to a greater or lesser degree, individuals' freedom and equality and their ability to exercise these capacities [of independent judgement and rational deliberation]. To promise to obey is to state, that in certain areas, the person making the promise  is no longer free to exercise her capacities and decide upon her own  actions, and is no longer equal, but subordinate."</i> [<b>The Problem of  Political Obligation</b>, p. 19] This results in those obeying no longer making their own decisions. Thus the rational for voluntarism (i.e. that individuals are capable of thinking for themselves and must be  allowed to express their individuality and make their own decisions) is violated in a hierarchical relationship as some are in charge and the many obey (see also <a href="secA2.html#seca28">section A.2.8</a>). Thus any voluntarism which generates relationships of subordination is, by its very nature, incomplete and violates its own justification.</p>
<p>This can be seen from capitalist society, in which workers sell their freedom to a boss in order to live.  In effect, under capitalism you are only free to the extent that you can choose whom you will obey! Freedom, however, must mean more than the right to change masters. Voluntary servitude is still servitude. For  if, as Rousseau put it, sovereignty, <i>"for the same reason as makes it inalienable, cannot be represented"</i> neither can it be sold nor temporarily nullified by a hiring contract. Rousseau famously argued that the <i>"people of England regards itself as free; but it is grossly mistaken; it is free only during the election of members of parliament. As soon as they are elected,  slavery overtakes it, and it is nothing."</i> [<b>The Social Contract and Discourses</b>, p. 266] Anarchists expand on this analysis. To  paraphrase Rousseau:</p>
<blockquote><p>Under capitalism the worker regards herself as free; but she is grossly  mistaken; she is free only when she signs her contract with her boss. As  soon as it is signed, slavery overtakes her and she is nothing but an order taker.
</p></blockquote>
<p>To see why, to see the injustice, we need only quote Rousseau:</p>
<blockquote><p><i> "That a rich and powerful man, having acquired immense possessions in land, should impose laws on those who want to establish themselves there, and that he should only allow them to do so on condition that they accept his supreme authority and obey all his wishes; that, I can still conceive . . . Would not this tyrannical act contain a double usurpation: that on the ownership of the land and that on the liberty of the inhabitants?"</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 316]
</p></blockquote>
<p>Hence Proudhon's comment that <i>"Man may be made by property a slave  or a despot by turns."</i> [<b>What is Property?</b>, p. 371] Little wonder we discover Bakunin rejecting <i>"any contract with another individual on  any footing but the utmost equality and reciprocity"</i> as this would  <i>"alienate his [or her] freedom"</i>  and so would be a <i>"a relationship of  voluntary servitude with another individual."</i> Anyone making such a contract in a free society (i.e. anarchist society) would be <i>"devoid of any sense of personal dignity."</i> [<b>Michael Bakunin: Selected Writings</b>,  pp. 68-9] Only self-managed associations can create relationships of equality rather than of subordination between its members.</p>
<p>Therefore anarchists stress the need for direct democracy in voluntary  associations in order to ensure that the concept of "freedom" is not a  sham and a justification for domination, as it is under capitalism. Only  self-managed associations can create relationships of equality rather  than of subordination between its members.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that anarchists have opposed capitalism and  urged <i>"workers to form themselves into democratic societies, with  equal conditions for all members, on pain of a relapse into feudalism."</i>  [Proudhon, <b>The General Idea of the Revolution</b>, p. 277] For similar  reasons, anarchists (with the notable exception of Proudhon) opposed  marriage as it turned women into <i>"a bonded slave, who takes her  master's name, her master's bread, her master's commands, and serves  her master's passions . . . who can control no property, not even her  own body, without his consent."</i> [Voltairine de Cleyre, <i>"Sex Slavery"</i>, <b>The Voltairine de Cleyre Reader</b>, p. 94] While marriage, due to feminist agitation, in many countries  has been reformed towards the anarchist ideal of a free union of equals,  it still is based on the patriarchal principles anarchists like Goldman and de Cleyre identified and condemned (see  <a href="secA3.html#seca35">section A.3.5</a> for more on feminism and anarchism).</p>
<p>Clearly, voluntary entry is a necessary but not a sufficient condition to defend an individual's liberty. This is to be expected as it ignores (or takes for granted) the social conditions in which agreements are  made and, moreover, ignores the social relationships created by them (<i>"For the worker who <b>must sell</b> his labour, it is impossible to  remain <b>free.</b>"</i> [Kropotkin, <b>Selected Writings on Anarchism and Revolution</b>, p. 305]). Any social relationships based on abstract individualism are likely to be based upon force, power, and authority, <b>not</b> liberty. This of course assumes a definition of liberty according to which individuals exercise their capacities and decide their own actions. Therefore, voluntarism is <b>not</b> enough to create a society that maximises liberty. This is why  anarchists think that voluntary association <b>must</b> be complemented by  self-management (direct democracy) <b>within</b> these associations. For  anarchists, the assumptions of voluntarism imply self-management. Or,  to use Proudhon's words, <i>"as individualism is the primordial fact of  humanity, so association is its complementary term."</i> [<b>System of  Economical Contradictions</b>, p. 430]</p>
<p>To answer the second objection first, in a society based on private  property (and so statism), those with property have more power,  which they can use to perpetuate their authority. <i>"Wealth is power,  poverty is weakness,"</i> in the words of Albert Parsons. This means  that under capitalism the much praised "freedom to choose" is  extremely limited. It becomes, for the vast majority, the freedom  to pick a master (under slavery, quipped Parsons, the master <i>"selected . . . his own slaves. Under the wage slavery system  the wage slave selects his master."</i>). Under capitalism, Parsons stressed, <i>"those disinherited of their natural rights must hire  out and serve and obey the oppressing class or starve. There  is no other alternative.  Some things are priceless, chief among  which are life and liberty. A freeman [or woman] is not for sale  or hire."</i> [<b>Anarchism</b>, p. 99 and p. 98] And why should we excuse  servitude or tolerate those who desire to restrict the liberty  of others? The "liberty" to command is the liberty to enslave,  and so is actually a denial of liberty.</p>
<p>Regarding the first objection, anarchists plead guilty. We <b>are</b> prejudiced against the reduction of human beings to the status of robots.  We are prejudiced in favour of human dignity and freedom. We are prejudiced, in fact, in favour of humanity and individuality.</p>
<p>(<a href="secA2.html#seca211"> Section A.2.11 </a> discusses why direct democracy is the necessary social counterpart to voluntarism (i.e. free agreement). <a href="secB4.html"> Section B.4</a> discusses why capitalism cannot be based on equal bargaining power between property owners and the propertyless).</p>

<h2>A.2.15 What about "human nature"?</h2>
<p>Anarchists, far from ignoring "human nature," have the only political  theory that gives this concept deep thought and reflection. Too often,  "human nature" is flung up as the last line of defence in an argument  against anarchism, because it is thought to be beyond reply. This is  not the case, however.    First of all, human nature is a complex thing. If, by human nature,  it is meant "what humans do," it is obvious that human nature is  contradictory -- love and hate, compassion and heartlessness, peace  and violence, and so on, have all been expressed by people and so  are all products of "human nature." Of course, what is considered  "human nature" can change with changing social circumstances. For  example, slavery was considered part of "human nature" and "normal"  for thousands of years. Homosexuality was considered perfectly  normal by the ancient Greeks yet thousands of years later the Christian church denounced it as unnatural. War only become  part of "human nature" once states developed. Hence Chomsky:</p>
<blockquote><p><i> "Individuals are certainly capable of evil . . . But individuals are capable of all sorts of things. Human nature has lots of ways of realising itself, humans have lots of capacities and options. Which ones reveal themselves depends to a large extent on the institutional structures. If we had institutions which permitted pathological killers free rein, they'd be running the place. The only way to survive would be to let those elements of your nature manifest themselves.<br>
</i></p>
<p><i>"If we have institutions which make greed the sole property of human beings and encourage pure greed at the expense of other  human emotions and commitments, we're going to have a society based on greed, with all that follows. A different society might be organised in such a way that human feelings and emotions of other sorts, say, solidarity, support, sympathy become dominant. Then you'll have different aspects of human nature and personality revealing themselves."</i> [<b>Chronicles of Dissent</b>, pp. 158]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, environment plays an important part in defining what  "human nature" is, how it develops and what aspects of it are  expressed. Indeed, one of the greatest myths about anarchism is the idea that we think human nature is inherently good (rather, we think it is inherently sociable). How it develops and expresses itself is dependent on the kind of society we live in and create. A hierarchical society will shape people in certain (negative)  ways and produce a "human nature" radically different from a libertarian one. So <i>"when we hear men [and women] saying that Anarchists imagine men [and women] much better than they really are, we merely wonder how intelligent people can repeat that nonsense. Do we not say continually that the only means of  rendering men [and women] less rapacious and egotistic, less ambitious and less slavish at the same time, is to eliminate those conditions which favour the growth of egotism and rapacity, of slavishness and ambition?"</i> [Peter Kropotkin, <b>Act for  Yourselves</b>, p. 83]</p>
<p>As such, the use of "human nature" as an argument against anarchism  is simply superficial and, ultimately, an evasion. It is an excuse  not to think. <i>"Every fool,"</i> as Emma Goldman put it, <i>"from king to  policemen, from the flatheaded parson to the visionless dabbler in  science, presumes to speak authoritatively of human nature. The  greater the mental charlatan, the more definite his insistence on  the wickedness and weakness of human nature. Yet how can any one  speak of it to-day, with every soul in prison, with every heart  fettered, wounded, and maimed?"</i> Change society, create a better social environment and then we can judge what is a product of  our natures and what is the product of an authoritarian system. For this reason, anarchism <i>"stands for the liberation of the  human mind from the dominion of religion; the liberation of the  human body from the dominion of property; liberation from the  shackles and restraint of government."</i> For <i>"[f]reedom, expansion,  opportunity, and above all, peace and repose, alone can teach us  the real dominant factors of human nature and all its wonderful  possibilities."</i> [<b>Red Emma Speaks</b>, p. 73]</p>
<p>This does not mean that human beings are infinitely plastic, with each individual born a <b>tabula rasa</b> (blank slate) waiting to be formed by "society" (which in practice means those who run it). As Noam Chomsky argues,  <i>"I don't think its possible to give a  rational account of the concept of alienated labour on that  assumption [that human nature is nothing but a historical  product], nor is it possible to produce something like a moral  justification for the commitment to some kind of social change,  except on the basis of assumptions about human nature and how  modifications in the structure of society will be better able to  conform to some of the fundamental needs that are part of our  essential nature."</i> [<b>Language and Politics</b>, p. 215] We do not wish to enter the debate about what human characteristics are and are not "innate." All we will say is that human beings have an innate ability to think and learn -- that much is obvious, we feel -- and that humans are sociable creatures, needing the company of others to feel complete and to prosper. Moreover, they have the ability to recognise and oppose injustice and  oppression (Bakunin rightly considered <i>"<b>the power to think</b>  and <b>the desire to rebel</b>"</i> as <i>"precious faculties."</i> [<b>God and the State</b>, p. 9]).</p>
<p>These three features, we think, suggest the viability of an anarchist society. The innate ability to think for oneself automatically makes all forms of hierarchy illegitimate, and our need for social relationships implies that we can organise without the state. The deep unhappiness and alienation afflicting modern society reveals that the centralisation and authoritarianism of capitalism and the state are denying some innate needs within us. In fact, as mentioned earlier, for the great majority of its existence the human race <b>has</b> lived in anarchic communities, with little or no hierarchy. That modern society calls such people "savages" or "primitive" is pure arrogance. So who can tell whether anarchism is against "human nature"? Anarchists have accumulated much evidence to suggest that it may not be.</p>
<p>As for the charge the anarchists demand too much of "human  nature," it is often <b>non</b> anarchists who make the greatest  claims on it. For <i>"while our opponents seem to admit there is  a kind of salt of the earth -- the rulers, the employers, the  leaders -- who, happily enough, prevent those bad men -- the  ruled, the exploited, the led -- from becoming still worse than  they are"</i> we anarchists <i>"maintain that <b>both</b> rulers and ruled are spoiled by authority"</i> and <i>"<b>both</b> exploiters and exploited are spoiled by exploitation."</i> So <i>"there is [a] difference, and a  very important one. <b>We</b> admit the imperfections of human  nature, but we make no exception for the rulers. <b>They</b> make  it, although sometimes unconsciously, and because we make no such exception, they say that we are dreamers."</i> [Peter  Kropotkin, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 83] If human nature is  so bad, then giving some people power over others and hoping  this will lead to justice and freedom is hopelessly utopian.</p>
<p>Moreover, as noted, Anarchists argue that hierarchical organisations  bring out the worse in human nature. Both the oppressor and the  oppressed are negatively affected by the authoritarian  relationships so produced. <i>"It is a characteristic of privilege  and of every kind of privilege,"</i> argued Bakunin, <i>"to kill the  mind and heart of man . . . That is a social law which admits  no exceptions . . . It is the law of equality and humanity."</i>  [<b>God and the State</b>, p. 31] And while the privileged become  corrupted by power, the powerless (in general) become servile  in heart and mind (luckily the human spirit is such that there will always be rebels no matter the oppression for where there is oppression, there is resistance and, consequently, hope). As  such, it seems strange for anarchists to hear non-anarchists  justify hierarchy in terms of the (distorted) "human nature" it  produces.</p>
<p>Sadly, too many have done precisely this. It continues to this day. For example, with the rise of "sociobiology," some claim   (with very little <b>real</b> evidence) that capitalism is a product  of our "nature," which is determined by our genes. These claims  are simply a new variation of the "human nature" argument and  have, unsurprisingly, been leapt upon by the powers that be.  Considering the dearth of evidence, their support for this  "new" doctrine must be purely the result of its utility to those  in power -- i.e. the fact that it is useful to have an "objective"  and "scientific" basis to rationalise inequalities in wealth and  power (for a discussion of this process see <b>Not in Our Genes: Biology, Ideology and Human Nature</b> by Steven Rose, R.C. Lewontin  and Leon J. Kamin).</p>
<p>This is not to say that it does not hold a grain of truth. As scientist Stephen Jay Gould notes, <i>"the range of our potential behaviour is circumscribed by our biology"</i> and if this is what sociobiology means <i>"by genetic control, then we can scarcely disagree."</i> However, this is not what is meant. Rather, it is a form of <i>"biological determinism"</i> that sociobiology argues for. Saying that there are specific genes for specific human traits says little for while <i>"[v]iolence, sexism, and general nastiness <b>are</b> biological since they represent one subset of a possible range of behaviours"</i> so are <i>"peacefulness, equality, and kindness."</i> And so <i>"we may see their influence increase if we can create  social structures that permit them to flourish."</i> That this may be the case can be seen from the works of sociobiologists  themselves, who <i>"acknowledge diversity"</i> in human cultures while <i>"often dismiss[ing] the uncomfortable 'exceptions' as temporary and unimportant aberrations."</i> This is surprising, for if you believe that <i>"repeated, often genocidal warfare has shaped our genetic destiny, the existence of nonaggressive peoples is embarrassing."</i> [<b>Ever Since Darwin</b>, p. 252, p. 257 and p. 254]</p>
<p>Like the social Darwinism that preceded it, sociobiology  proceeds by first projecting the dominant ideas of current society  onto nature (often unconsciously, so that scientists mistakenly  consider the ideas in question as both "normal" and "natural").  Bookchin refers to this as <i>"the subtle projection of historically  conditioned human values"</i> onto nature rather than <i>"scientific  objectivity."</i> Then the theories of nature produced in this manner  are transferred <b>back</b> onto society and history, being used to "prove"  that the principles of capitalism (hierarchy, authority, competition,  etc.) are eternal <b>laws,</b> which are then appealed to as a justification  for the status quo! <i>"What this procedure does accomplish,"</i> notes  Bookchin, <i>"is reinforce human social hierarchies by justifying the  command of men and women as innate features of the 'natural order.'  Human domination is thereby transcribed into the genetic code as biologically immutable."</i> [<b>The Ecology of Freedom</b>, p. 95 and p. 92] Amazingly, there are many supposedly intelligent  people who take this sleight-of-hand seriously.</p>
<p>This can be seen when "hierarchies" in nature are used to explain, and so justify, hierarchies in human societies. Such analogies are misleading for they forget the institutional nature of  human life. As Murray Bookchin notes in his critique of sociobiology,  a <i>"weak, enfeebled, unnerved, and sick ape is hardly likely to become  an 'alpha' male, much less retain this highly ephemeral 'status.' By contrast, the most physically and mentally pathological human rulers have exercised authority with devastating effect in the course of history."</i> This <i>"expresses a power of hierarchical <b>institutions</b> over persons that is completely reversed in so-called 'animal hierarchies' where the absence of institutions is precisely the only intelligible way of talking about 'alpha males' or 'queen bees.'"</i> [<i>"Sociobiology or Social Ecology"</i>, <b>Which way for the Ecology Movement?</b>, p. 58] Thus what makes human society unique is conveniently ignored and the real  sources of power in society are hidden under a genetic screen.</p>
<p>The sort of apologetics associated with appeals to "human nature"  (or sociobiology at its worse) are natural, of course, because every  ruling class needs to justify their right to rule. Hence they support  doctrines that defined the latter in ways appearing to justify elite  power -- be it sociobiology, divine right, original sin, etc. Obviously,  such doctrines have always been wrong . . . until now, of course, as  it is obvious our current society truly conforms to "human nature" and  it has been scientifically proven by our current scientific priesthood!</p>
<p>The arrogance of this claim is truly amazing. History hasn't stopped. One  thousand years from now, society will be completely different from what it  is presently or from what anyone has imagined. No government in place at the  moment will still be around, and the current economic system will not exist.  The only thing that may remain the same is that people will still be claiming  that their new society is the "One True System" that completely conforms to  human nature, even though all past systems did not.</p>
<p>Of course, it does not cross the minds of supporters of capitalism that people from different cultures may draw different conclusions from the same facts -- conclusions that may be <b>more</b> valid. Nor does it occur to capitalist apologists that the theories of the "objective" scientists may be framed in the context of the dominant ideas of the society they live in. It comes as no surprise to anarchists, however, that scientists working in Tsarist Russia developed a theory of evolution based on <b>cooperation</b> within species, quite unlike their counterparts in capitalist Britain, who developed a theory based on <b>competitive struggle</b> within and between species. That the latter theory reflected the dominant political and economic theories of British society (notably competitive individualism) is pure coincidence, of course.</p>
<p>Kropotkin's classic work <b>Mutual Aid</b>, for example, was written in  response to the obvious inaccuracies that British representatives of  Darwinism had projected onto nature and human life. Building upon the  mainstream Russian criticism of the British Darwinism of the time,  Kropotkin showed (with substantial empirical evidence) that "mutual  aid" within a group or species played as important a role as "mutual  struggle" between individuals within those groups or species (see Stephan Jay Gould's essay <i>"Kropotkin was no Crackpot"</i> in his book <b>Bully for Brontosaurus</b> for details and an evaluation). It was, he  stressed, a <i>"factor"</i> in evolution along with competition, a factor which, in most circumstances, was far more important to survival.  Thus co-operation is just as "natural" as competition so proving  that "human nature" was not a barrier to anarchism as co-operation between members of a species can be the best pathway to advantage individuals.</p>
<p>To conclude. Anarchists argue that anarchy is not against "human nature" for two main reasons. Firstly, what is considered as being "human nature"  is shaped by the society we live in and the relationships we create. This means a hierarchical society will encourage certain personality traits to dominate while an anarchist one would encourage others. As such, anarchists <i>"do not so much rely on the fact that human nature will change as they do upon the theory that the same nature will act differently under different circumstances."</i> Secondly, change <i>"seems to be one of  the fundamental laws of existence"</i> so <i>"who can say that man [sic!] has  reached the limits of his possibilities."</i> [George Barrett, <b>Objections to Anarchism</b>, pp. 360-1 and p. 360]</p>
<p>For useful discussions on anarchist ideas on human nature, both of which refute the idea that anarchists think human beings are naturally good, see Peter Marshall's <i>"Human nature and anarchism"</i> [David Goodway (ed.), <b>For Anarchism: History, Theory and Practice</b>, pp. 127-149] and David Hartley's <i>"Communitarian Anarchism and Human Nature"</i>.  [<b>Anarchist Studies</b>, vol. 3, no. 2, Autumn 1995, pp. 145-164]</p>

<h2>A.2.16 Does anarchism require "perfect" people to work?</h2>
<p>No. Anarchy is not a utopia, a "perfect" society. It will be a  <b><i>human</i></b> society, with all the problems, hopes, and fears associated with human  beings. Anarchists do not think that human beings need to be "perfect"  for anarchy to work. They only need to be free. Thus Christie and  Meltzer:</p>
<blockquote><p><i> "[A] common fallacy [is] that revolutionary socialism [i.e. anarchism] is an 'idealisation' of the workers and [so] the mere recital of their present faults is a refutation of the class struggle . . . it seems morally unreasonable that a free society . .  . could exist without moral or ethical perfection. But so far as the overthrow of [existing] society is concerned, we may ignore the fact of people's shortcomings and prejudices, so long as they do not become institutionalised. One may view without concern the fact . . . that the workers might achieve control of their places of work long before they had acquired the social graces of the 'intellectual' or shed all the prejudices of the present society from family discipline to xenophobia. What does it matter, so long as they can run industry without masters? Prejudices wither in freedom and only flourish while the social climate is  favourable to them . . . What we say is . . . that once life can  continue without imposed authority from above, and imposed authority cannot survive the withdrawal of labour from its service, the prejudices of authoritarianism will disappear. There is no cure for them other than the free process of education."</i> [<b>The Floodgates of Anarchy</b>, pp. 36-7]
</p></blockquote>
<p>Obviously, though, we think that a free society will produce people who   are more in tune with both their own and others individuality and needs,   thus reducing individual conflict. Remaining disputes would be solved by   reasonable methods, for example, the use of juries, mutual third parties,   or community and workplace assemblies (see  <a href="secI5.html#seci58">section I.5.8</a> for a discussion of how could be done for anti-social activities as well as disputes).</p>
<p>Like the "anarchism-is-against-human-nature" argument (see <a href="secA2.html#seca215">section A.2.15</a>), opponents of anarchism usually assume "perfect" people --  people who are not corrupted by power when placed in positions of  authority, people who are strangely unaffected by the distorting effects  of hierarchy, privilege, and so forth. However, anarchists make no such   claims about human perfection. We simply recognise that vesting power  in the hands of one person or an elite is never a good idea, as people  are not perfect.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the idea that anarchism requires a "new" (perfect) man or woman is often raised by the opponents of anarchism to discredit  it (and, usually, to justify the retention of hierarchical authority,  particularly capitalist relations of production). After all, people are not perfect and are unlikely ever to be. As such, they pounce on every example of a government falling and the resulting chaos to dismiss  anarchism as unrealistic. The media loves to proclaim a country to be falling into "anarchy" whenever there is a disruption in "law and order" and looting takes place.</p>
<p>Anarchists are not impressed by this argument. A moment's reflection  shows why, for the detractors make the basic mistake of assuming  an anarchist society without anarchists! (A variation of such claims  is raised by the right-wing "anarcho"-capitalists to discredit real  anarchism. However, their "objection" discredits their own claim to  be anarchists for they implicitly assume an anarchist society without anarchists!). Needless to say, an "anarchy" made up of people who  still saw the need for authority, property and statism would soon  become authoritarian (i.e. non-anarchist) again. This is because  even if the government disappeared tomorrow, the same system  would soon grow up again, because <i>"the strength of the government  rests not with itself, but with the people. A great tyrant may be a  fool, and not a superman. His strength lies not in himself, but in the  superstition of the people who think that it is right to obey him. So  long as that superstition exists it is useless for some liberator to  cut off the head of tyranny; the people will create another, for  they have grown accustomed to rely on something outside themselves."</i>  [George Barrett, <b>Objections to Anarchism</b>, p. 355]</p>
<p>Hence Alexander Berkman:</p>
<blockquote><p><i> "Our social institutions are founded on certain ideas; as long as the latter are generally believed, the institutions built on them are safe. Government remains strong because people think political authority and legal compulsion necessary. Capitalism will continue as long as such an economic system is considered adequate and just. The weakening of the ideas which support the evil and oppressive present day conditions means the ultimate breakdown of government and capitalism."</i> [<b>What is Anarchism?</b>, p. xii]
</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, anarchy needs <b><i>anarchists</i></b> in order to be created and  survive. But these anarchists need not be perfect, just people who  have freed themselves, by their own efforts, of the superstition that  command-and-obedience relations and capitalist property rights are  necessary. The implicit assumption in the idea that anarchy needs  "perfect" people is that freedom will be given, not taken; hence the  obvious conclusion follows that an anarchy requiring "perfect" people  will fail. But this argument ignores the need for self-activity and  self-liberation in order to create a free society. For anarchists,  <i>"history is nothing but a struggle between the rulers and the ruled,  the oppressors and the oppressed."</i> [Peter Kropotkin, <b>Act for  Yourselves</b>,  p. 85] Ideas change through struggle and, consequently, in the struggle against oppression and exploitation, we not only change the world, we  change ourselves at the same time. So it is the struggle for freedom  which creates people capable of taking the responsibility for their  own lives, communities and planet. People capable of living as equals  in a free society, so making anarchy possible.</p>
<p>As such, the chaos which often results when a government disappears is  not anarchy nor, in fact, a case against anarchism. It simple means that  the necessary preconditions for creating an anarchist society do not  exist. Anarchy would be the product of collective struggle at the heart  of society, not the product of external shocks. Nor, we should note, do anarchists think that such a society will appear "overnight." Rather,  we see the creation of an anarchist system as a process, not an event. The ins-and-outs of how it would function will evolve over time in the light of experience and objective circumstances, not appear in a perfect  form immediately (see <a href="secH2.html#sech25">section H.2.5</a>  for a discussion of Marxist claims otherwise).</p>
<p>Therefore, anarchists do not conclude that "perfect" people are necessary anarchism to work because the anarchist is <i>"no liberator with a divine  mission to free humanity, but he is a part of that humanity struggling  onwards towards liberty."</i> As such, <i>"[i]f, then, by some external means  an Anarchist Revolution could be, so to speak, supplied ready-made and  thrust upon the people, it is true that they would reject it and rebuild  the old society. If, on the other hand, the people develop their ideas  of freedom, and they themselves get rid of the last stronghold of  tyranny --- the government -- then indeed the revolution will be  permanently accomplished."</i> [George Barrett, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 355]</p>
<p>This is not to suggest that an anarchist society must wait until <b><i>everyone</i></b> is an anarchist. Far from it. It is highly unlikely, for example, that the rich and powerful will suddenly see the errors of their ways and voluntarily renounce their privileges. Faced with a large and growing anarchist movement, the ruling elite has always used repression to defend its position in society. The use of fascism in Spain (see <a href="secA5.html#seca56">section  A.5.6</a>) and Italy (see <a href="secA5.html#seca55">section A.5.5</a>) show  the depths the capitalist class can sink to. Anarchism will be created in the face of opposition by the ruling minorities and, consequently, will need to defend itself against attempts to recreate authority (see <a href="secH2.html#sech21"> section H.2.1</a> for a refutation  of Marxist claims anarchists reject the need to defend an anarchist society against counter-revolution).</p>
<p>Instead anarchists argue that we should focus our activity on convincing those subject to oppression and exploitation that  they have the power to resist both and, ultimately, can end  both by destroying the social institutions that cause them. As Malatesta argued, <i>"we need the support of the masses to build a force of sufficient strength to achieve our specific task of radical change in the social organism by the direct action of the masses, we must get closer to them, accept them as they are, and from within their ranks seek to 'push' them forward as much as possible."</i> [<b>Errico Malatesta: His Life and  Ideas</b>, pp. 155-6] This would create the conditions that make possible a rapid evolution towards anarchism as what was  initially accepted by a minority <i>"but increasingly finding popular expression, will make its way among the mass of the people"</i> and <i>"the minority will become the People, the great mass, and that mass rising up against property and the State, will march forward towards anarchist communism."</i> [Kropotkin, <b>Words of a Rebel</b>, p. 75] Hence the importance anarchists attach to spreading our ideas and arguing the case for anarchism. This creates conscious anarchists from those  questioning the injustices of capitalism and the state.</p>
<p>This process is helped by the nature of hierarchical society and the resistance it naturally developed in those subject to it. Anarchist ideas develop spontaneously through struggle. As we  discuss in <a href="secI2.html#seci23">section I.2.3</a>,  anarchistic organisations are often  created as part of the resistance against oppression and exploitation which marks every hierarchical system and can., potentially, be the framework of a few society. As such, the creation of libertarian  institutions is, therefore, always a possibility in any situation.  A peoples' experiences may push them towards anarchist conclusions,  namely the awareness that the state exists to protect the wealthy  and powerful few and to disempower the many. That while it is needed  to maintain class and hierarchical society, it is not needed to  organise society nor can it do so in a just and fair way for all.  This is possible. However, without a conscious anarchist presence  any libertarian tendencies are likely to be used, abused and finally  destroyed by parties or religious groups seeking political power  over the masses (the Russian Revolution is the most famous example of this process). It is for that reason anarchists organise to influence the struggle and spread our ideas (see <a href="secJ3.html"> section J.3</a> for  details). For it is the case that only when anarchist ideas  <i>"acquire a predominating influence"</i> and are <i>"accepted by a  sufficiently large section of the population"</i> will we <i>"have  achieved anarchy, or taken a step towards anarchy."</i> For  anarchy <i>"cannot be imposed against the wishes of the people."</i> [Malatesta, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 159 and p. 163]</p>
<p>So, to conclude, the creation of an anarchist society is not dependent  on people being perfect but it is dependent on a large majority being  anarchists and wanting to reorganise society in a libertarian manner.  This will not eliminate conflict between individuals nor create a fully formed anarchist humanity overnight but it will lay the ground  for the gradual elimination of whatever prejudices and anti-social  behaviour that remain after the struggle to change society has  revolutionised those doing it.</p>

<h2>A.2.17 Aren't most people too stupid for a free society to work?</h2>
<p>We are sorry to have to include this question in an anarchist FAQ, but we know that many political ideologies explicitly assume that ordinary people are too stupid to be able to manage their own lives and run society. All aspects of the capitalist political agenda, from Left to Right, contain people who make this claim. Be it Leninists, fascists, Fabians or Objectivists, it is assumed that only a select few are creative and intelligent and that these people should govern others. Usually, this elitism is masked by fine, flowing rhetoric about "freedom," "democracy" and other platitudes with which the ideologues attempt to dull people's critical thought by telling them want they want to hear.</p>
<p>It is, of course, also no surprise that those who believe in "natural" elites always class themselves at the top. We have yet to discover an "objectivist", for example, who considers themselves part of the great mass of "second-handers" (it is always amusing to hear people who  simply parrot the ideas of Ayn Rand dismissing other people so!)  or who will be a toilet cleaner in the unknown "ideal" of "real" capitalism. Everybody reading an elitist text will consider him or herself to be part of the "select few." It's "natural" in an elitist society to consider elites to be natural and yourself a potential member of one!</p>
<p>Examination of history shows that there is a basic elitist ideology which  has been the essential rationalisation of all states and ruling classes  since their emergence at the beginning of the Bronze Age (<i>"if the legacy  of domination had had any broader purpose than the support of hierarchical  and class interests, it has been the attemp to exorcise the belief in public  competence from social discourse itself."</i> [Bookchin, <b>The Ecology of Freedom</b>, p. 206]). This ideology merely changes its outer garments, not  its basic inner content over time.</p>
<p>During the Dark Ages, for example, it was coloured by Christianity, being  adapted to the needs of the Church hierarchy. The most useful "divinely  revealed" dogma to the priestly elite was "original sin": the notion that  human beings are basically depraved and incompetent creatures who need "direction from above," with priests as the conveniently necessary mediators between ordinary humans and "God." The idea that average people are basically stupid and thus incapable of governing themselves is a carry over from this doctrine, a relic of the Dark Ages.</p>
<p>In reply to all those who claim that most people are "second-handers" or cannot develop anything more than "trade union consciousness," all we can say is that it is an absurdity that cannot withstand even a superficial look at history, particularly the labour movement. The creative powers of those struggling for freedom is often truly amazing, and if this intellectual power and inspiration is not seen in "normal" society, this is the clearest indictment possible of the deadening effects of hierarchy and the conformity produced by authority. (See also <a href="secB1.html">  section B.1</a> for more on the effects of hierarchy). As Bob Black points  outs:</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>"You are what you do. If you do boring, stupid,  monotonous work, chances are you'll end up boring, stupid, and  monotonous. Work is a much better explanation for the creeping  cretinisation all around us than even such significant moronising  mechanisms as television and education. People who are regimented all  their lives, handed to work from school and bracketed by the family in the  beginning and the nursing home in the end, are habituated to hierarchy and  psychologically enslaved. Their aptitude for autonomy is so atrophied that  their fear of freedom is among their few rationally grounded phobias.  Their obedience training at work carries over into the families <b>they</b>  start, thus reproducing the system in more ways than one, and into  politics, culture and everything else. Once you drain the vitality from  people at work, they'll likely submit to hierarchy and expertise in  everything. They're used to it." </i>[<b>The Abolition of Work and other essays</b>, pp. 21-2]
</p></blockquote>
<p>When elitists try to conceive of liberation, they can only think of it being <b>given</b> to the oppressed by kind (for Leninists) or stupid (for Objectivists) elites. It is hardly surprising, then, that it fails. Only self-liberation can produce a free society. The crushing and distorting  effects of authority can only be overcome by self-activity. The few examples of such self-liberation prove that most people, once considered incapable of freedom by others, are more than up for the task.</p>
<p>Those who proclaim their "superiority" often do so out of fear that their authority and power will be destroyed once people free themselves from the debilitating hands of authority and come to realise that, in the words of Max Stirner, <i>"the great are great only because we are on our knees. Let us rise"</i></p>
<p>As Emma Goldman remarks about women's equality, <i>"[t]he extraordinary achievements of women in every walk of life have silenced forever the  loose talk of women's inferiority. Those who still cling to this fetish do  so because they hate nothing so much as to see their authority challenged.  This is the characteristic of all authority, whether the master over his  economic slaves or man over women. However, everywhere woman is escaping  her cage, everywhere she is going ahead with free, large strides."</i> [<b>Vision on Fire</b>, p. 256] The same comments are applicable, for example, to the very successful experiments in workers' self-management during the Spanish Revolution.</p>
<p>Then, of course, the notion that people are too stupid for anarchism to work also backfires on those who argue it. Take, for example, those who use this argument to advocate democratic government rather than anarchy. Democracy, as Luigi Galleani noted, means <i>"acknowledging the right and the competence of the people to select their rulers."</i> However, <i>"whoever has the political competence to choose his [or her] own rulers is, by implication, also competent to do without them, especially when the causes of economic enmity are uprooted."</i> [<b>The End of Anarchism?</b>, p. 37] Thus the argument for democracy against anarchism undermines itself, for <i>"if you consider these worthy electors  as unable to look after their own interests themselves, how is it that  they know how to choose for themselves the shepherds who must guide them?  And how will they be able to solve this problem of social alchemy, of  producing the election of a genius from the votes of a mass of fools?"</i>  [Malatesta, <b>Anarchy</b>, pp. 53-4]</p>
<p>As for those who consider dictatorship as the solution to human stupidity,  the question arises why are these dictators immune to this apparently  universal human trait? And, as Malatesta noted, <i>"who are the best? And who will recognise these qualities in them?"</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 53] If they  impose themselves on the "stupid" masses, why assume they will not exploit  and oppress the many for their own benefit? Or, for that matter, that they  are any more intelligent than the masses? The history of dictatorial and  monarchical government suggests a clear answer to those questions. A similar  argument applies for other non-democratic systems, such as those based on limited suffrage. For example, the Lockean (i.e. classical liberal or right-wing libertarian) ideal of a state based on the rule of property owners is doomed to be little more than a regime which oppresses the  majority to maintain the power and privilege of the wealthy few. Equally,  the idea of near universal stupidity bar an elite of capitalists (the  "objectivist" vision) implies a system somewhat less ideal than the  perfect system presented in the literature. This is because most people  would tolerate oppressive bosses who treat them as means to an end rather than an end in themselves. For how can you expect people to  recognise and pursue their own self-interest if you consider them  fundamentally as the <i>"uncivilised hordes"</i>? You cannot have it both ways and the <i>"unknown ideal"</i> of pure capitalism would be as grubby, oppressive  and alienating as "actually existing" capitalism.</p>
<p>As such, anarchists are firmly convinced that arguments against anarchy  based on the lack of ability of the mass of people are inherently  self-contradictory (when not blatantly self-servicing). If people  are too stupid for anarchism then they are too stupid for any system you  care to mention. Ultimately, anarchists argue that such a perspective simply reflects the servile mentality produced by a hierarchical society rather than a genuine analysis of humanity and our history as a species. To quote Rousseau:</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>"when I see multitudes of entirely naked savages scorn European voluptuousness and endure hunger, fire, the sword, and death to preserve  only their independence, I feel that it does not behove slaves to reason  about freedom."</i> [quoted by Noam Chomsky, <b>Marxism, Anarchism, and  Alternative Futures</b>, p. 780]

<h2>A.2.18 Do anarchists support terrorism?</h2>
<p>No. This is for three reasons.</p>
<p>Terrorism means either targeting or not  worrying about killing innocent people. For anarchy to exist, it must be  created by the mass of people. One does not convince people of one's ideas  by blowing them up. Secondly, anarchism is about self-liberation. One  cannot blow up a social relationship. Freedom cannot be created by the  actions of an elite few destroying rulers <b>on behalf of</b> the majority.   Simply put, a <i>"structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a  few kilos of explosives."</i> [Kropotkin, quoted by Martin A. Millar,  <b>Kropotkin</b>, p. 174] For so long as people feel the need for rulers, hierarchy will exist (see  <a href="secA2.html#seca216">section A.2.16</a> for more on this). As we have stressed earlier, freedom  cannot be given, only taken. Lastly, anarchism aims for freedom. Hence Bakunin's comment that <i>"when one is carrying out a revolution for the liberation of humanity, one should respect the life and liberty of men [and women]."</i> [quoted by K.J. Kenafick, <b>Michael Bakunin and  Karl Marx</b>, p. 125] For anarchists, means determine the ends and  terrorism by its very nature violates life and liberty of individuals and so cannot be used to create an anarchist society. The history of, say, the Russian Revolution,  confirmed Kropotkin's insight that <i>"[v]ery sad would be the future revolution if it could only triumph by terror."</i> [quoted by Millar, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 175]</p>
<p>Moreover anarchists are <b>not</b> against individuals but the institutions  and social relationships that cause certain individuals to have power  over others and abuse (i.e. use) that power. Therefore the anarchist  revolution is about destroying structures, not people. As Bakunin  pointed out, <i>"we wish not to kill persons, but to abolish status  and its perquisites"</i> and anarchism <i>"does not mean the death of  the individuals who make up the bourgeoisie, but the death of the  bourgeoisie as a political and social entity economically distinct  from the working class."</i> [<b>The Basic Bakunin</b>, p. 71 and p. 70] In  other words, <b><i>"You can't blow up a social relationship"</i></b> (to quote  the title of an anarchist pamphlet which presents the anarchist  case against terrorism).</p>
<p>How is it, then, that anarchism is associated with violence? Partly  this is because the state and media insist on referring to terrorists  who are <b>not</b> anarchists as anarchists. For example, the German  Baader-Meinhoff gang were often called "anarchists" despite their  self-proclaimed Marxist-Leninism. Smears, unfortunately, work.  Similarly, as Emma Goldman pointed out, <i>"it is a known fact known to almost everyone familiar with the Anarchist movement that a great number of [violent] acts, for which Anarchists had to suffer, either originated with the capitalist press or were instigated, if not directly perpetrated, by the police."</i>  [<b>Red Emma Speaks</b>, p. 262]</p>
<p>An example of this process at work can be seen from the current anti-globalisation movement. In Seattle, for example, the media reported "violence" by protestors (particularly anarchist ones) yet this amounted to a few broken windows. The much greater  <b>actual</b> violence of the police against protestors (which,  incidentally, started <b>before</b> the breaking of a single window)  was not considered worthy of comment. Subsequent media coverage of anti-globalisation demonstrations followed this pattern, firmly connecting anarchism with violence in spite of that the protesters have been the ones to suffer the greatest violence at the hands of the state. As anarchist activist Starhawk notes, <i>"if breaking  windows and fighting back when the cops attack is 'violence,' then  give me a new word, a word a thousand times stronger, to use when  the cops are beating non-resisting people into comas."</i> [<b>Staying  on the Streets</b>, p. 130]</p>
<p>Similarly, at the Genoa protests in 2001 the mainstream media presented  the protestors as violent even though it was the state who killed one  of them and hospitalised many thousands more. The presence of police  agent provocateurs in creating the violence was unmentioned by the  media. As Starhawk noted afterwards, in Genoa <i>"we encountered a  carefully orchestrated political campaign of state terrorism. The  campaign included disinformation, the use of infiltrators and  provocateurs, collusion with avowed Fascist groups . . . , the  deliberate targeting of non-violent groups for tear gas and beating,  endemic police brutality, the torture of prisoners, the political  persecution of organisers . . . They did all those openly, in a way  that indicates they had no fear of repercussions and expected political  protection from the highest sources."</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, pp. 128-9] This was, unsurprisingly, not reported by the media.</p>
<p>Subsequent protests have seen the media indulge in yet more  anti-anarchist hype, inventing stories to present anarchists are hate-filled individuals planning mass violence. For example, in Ireland in 2004 the media reported that anarchists were planning to use poison gas during EU related celebrations in Dublin. Of course, evidence of such a plan was not forthcoming and no such action happened. Neither did the riot the media said anarchists were  organising. A similar process of misinformation accompanied the anti-capitalist May Day demonstrations in London and the protests against the Republican National Congress in New York. In spite of being constantly proved wrong after the event, the media always prints the scare stories of anarchist violence (even inventing events at, say Seattle, to justify their articles and to demonise  anarchism further). Thus the myth that anarchism equals violence is perpetrated. Needless to say, the same papers that hyped the (non-existent) threat of anarchist violence remained silent on the actual violence of, and repression by, the police against demonstrators which occurred at these events. Neither did they run apologies after  their (evidence-less) stories of doom were exposed as the nonsense  they were by subsequent events.</p>
<p>This does not mean that Anarchists have not committed acts of  violence. They have (as have members of other political and  religious movements). The main reason for the association of  terrorism with anarchism is because of the <b><i>"propaganda by the  deed"</i></b> period in the anarchist movement.</p>
<p>This period -- roughly from 1880 to 1900 -- was marked by a small  number of anarchists assassinating members of the ruling class  (royalty, politicians and so forth). At its worse, this period saw  theatres and shops frequented by members of the bourgeoisie targeted.  These acts were termed <i>"propaganda by the deed."</i> Anarchist support for  the tactic was galvanised by the assassination of Tsar Alexander II in  1881 by Russian Populists (this event prompted Johann Most's famous  editorial in <b>Freiheit</b>, entitled <i>"At Last!"</i>, celebrating regicide  and the assassination of tyrants). However, there were deeper reasons  for anarchist support of this tactic: firstly, in revenge for acts  of repression directed towards working class people; and secondly,  as a means to encourage people to revolt by showing that their  oppressors could be defeated.</p>
<p>Considering these reasons it is no coincidence that propaganda by  the deed began in France after the 20 000-plus deaths due to the  French state's brutal suppression of the Paris Commune, in which  many anarchists were killed. It is interesting to note that while  the anarchist violence in revenge for the Commune is relatively well  known, the state's mass murder of the Communards is relatively unknown. Similarly, it may be known that the Italian Anarchist Gaetano Bresci assassinated King Umberto of Italy in 1900 or that Alexander Berkman tried to kill Carnegie Steel Corporation manager Henry Clay Frick in 1892. What is often unknown is that Umberto's troops had fired upon  and killed protesting peasants or that Frick's Pinkertons had also murdered locked-out workers at Homestead.</p>
<p>Such downplaying of statist and capitalist violence is hardly  surprising. <i>"The State's behaviour is violence,"</i> points out Max Stirner, <i>"and it calls its violence 'law'; that of the individual, 'crime.'"</i> [<b>The Ego and Its Own</b>, p. 197] Little wonder, then, that anarchist violence is condemned but the repression (and often worse violence) that provoked it ignored  and forgotten. Anarchists point to the hypocrisy of the accusation that anarchists are "violent" given that such claims come from  either supporters of government or the actual governments themselves, governments <i>"which came into being through violence, which maintain themselves in power through violence, and which use violence  constantly to keep down rebellion and to bully other nations."</i> [Howard Zinn, <b>The Zinn Reader</b>, p. 652]</p>
<p>We can get a feel of the hypocrisy surrounding condemnation of  anarchist violence by non-anarchists by considering their response  to state violence. For example, many capitalist papers and individuals  in the 1920s and 1930s celebrated Fascism as well as Mussolini and  Hitler. Anarchists, in contrast, fought Fascism to the death and  tried to assassinate both Mussolini and Hitler. Obviously supporting murderous dictatorships is not "violence" and "terrorism" but  resisting such regimes is! Similarly, non-anarchists can support  repressive and authoritarian states, war and the suppression of strikes and unrest by violence ("restoring law and order") and not be considered "violent." Anarchists, in contrast, are condemned as "violent" and "terrorist" because a few of them tried to revenge such acts of oppression and  state/capitalist violence! Similarly, it seems the height of hypocrisy for someone to denounce the anarchist "violence" which produces a few broken windows in, say, Seattle while supporting the actual violence of the police in imposing the state's rule or, even worse, supporting the American invasion of Iraq in 2003. If anyone should be considered violent it is the supporter of state and its actions yet people do not see the obvious and <i>"deplore the type of violence that the  state deplores, and applaud the violence that the state practises."</i> [Christie and Meltzer, <b>The Floodgates of Anarchy</b>, p. 132]</p>
<p>It must be noted that the majority of anarchists did not support  this tactic. Of those who committed "propaganda by the deed"  (sometimes called <i>"attentats"</i>), as Murray Bookchin points out, only a <i>"few . . .  were members of Anarchist groups. The majority . . . were soloists."</i> [<b>The Spanish Anarchists</b>, p. 102] Needless to say, the state and media painted all anarchists with the same brush. They still do, usually inaccurately (such as blaming Bakunin for such acts even though he had been dead years before the tactic was even discussed in anarchist circles or by labelling non-anarchist groups anarchists!).</p>
<p>All in all, the "propaganda by the deed" phase of anarchism was  a failure, as the vast majority of anarchists soon came to see.  Kropotkin can be considered typical. He <i>"never liked the slogan  <b>propaganda by deed</b>, and did not use it to describe his own  ideas of revolutionary action."</i> However, in 1879 while still  <i>"urg[ing] the importance of collective action"</i> he started  <i>"expressing considerable sympathy and interest in <b>attentats</b>"</i>  (these <i>"collective forms of action"</i> were seen as acting <i>"at  the trade union and communal level"</i>). In 1880 he <i>"became less preoccupied with collective action and this enthusiasm for acts of revolt by individuals and small groups increased."</i>  This did not last and Kropotkin soon attached <i>"progressively  less importance to isolated acts of revolt"</i> particularly once  <i>"he saw greater opportunities for developing collective action in the new militant trade unionism."</i> [Caroline Cahm, <b>Kropotkin  and the Rise of Revolutionary Anarchism</b>, p. 92, p. 115, p. 129,  pp. 129-30, p. 205] By the late 1880s and early 1890s he came to disapprove of such acts of violence. This was  partly due to simple revulsion at the worse of the acts (such as  the Barcelona Theatre bombing in response to the state murder  of anarchists involved in the Jerez uprising of 1892 and Emile  Henry's bombing of a cafe in response to state repression) and  partly due to the awareness that it was hindering the anarchist  cause.</p>
<p>Kropotkin recognised that the <i>"spate of terrorist acts"</i> of the  1880s had caused <i>"the authorities into taking repressive action  against the movement"</i> and were <i>"not in his view consistent  with the anarchist ideal and did little or nothing to promote popular revolt."</i> In addition, he was <i>"anxious about the  isolation of the movement from the masses"</i> which <i>"had increased  rather than diminished as a result of the preoccupation with"</i>  propaganda by deed. He <i>"saw the best possibility for popular  revolution in the . . . development of the new militancy in the  labour movement. From now on he focussed his attention increasingly  on the importance of revolutionary minorities working among the masses to develop the spirit of revolt."</i> However, even during the early 1880s when his support for individual acts of revolt  (if not for propaganda by the deed) was highest, he saw the  need for collective class struggle and, therefore, <i>"Kropotkin  always insisted on the importance of the labour movement in the  struggles leading up to the revolution."</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>,  pp. 205-6, p. 208 and p. 280]</p>
<p>Kropotkin was not alone. More and more anarchists came to see  "propaganda by the deed" as giving the state an excuse to clamp  down on both the anarchist and labour movements. Moreover, it  gave the media (and opponents of anarchism) a chance to associate  anarchism with mindless violence, thus alienating much of the  population from the movement. This false association is renewed  at every opportunity, regardless of the facts (for example, even  though Individualist Anarchists rejected "propaganda by the deed"  totally, they were also smeared by the press as "violent" and  "terrorists").</p>
<p>In addition, as Kropotkin pointed out, the assumption behind propaganda  by the deed, i.e. that everyone was waiting for a chance to rebel, was  false. In fact, people are products of the system in which  they live; hence they accepted most of the myths used to  keep that system going. With the failure of propaganda by  deed, anarchists turned back to what most of the movement  had been doing anyway: encouraging the class struggle and  the process of self-liberation. This turn back to the roots  of anarchism can be seen from the rise in anarcho-syndicalist  unions after 1890 (see <a href="secA2.html#seca53">section A.5.3</a>).  This position flows naturally from anarchist  theory, unlike the idea of individual acts of violence:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>  "to bring about a revolution, and specially the Anarchist revolution[, it]  is necessary that the people be conscious of their rights and their strength; it is necessary that they be ready to fight and ready to take the conduct of their affairs into their own hands. It must be the constant preoccupation of the revolutionists, the point towards which all their activity must aim, to bring about this state of mind among the masses . . . Who expects the emancipation of mankind to come, not from the persistent and harmonious co-operation of all men [and women] of progress, but from the accidental or providential happening of some acts of heroism, is  not better advised that one who expected it from the intervention of an ingenious legislator or of a victorious general . . . our ideas oblige us to put all our hopes in the masses, because we do not believe in the possibility of imposing good by force and we do not want to be commanded . . . Today, that which . . . was the logical outcome of our ideas, the condition which our conception of the revolution and reorganisation of society imposes on us . . . [is] to live among the people and to win  them over to our ideas by actively taking part in their struggles and sufferings."</i> [Errico Malatesta, <i>"The Duties of the Present Hour"</i>,  pp. 181-3, <b>Anarchism</b>, Robert Graham (ed.), pp. 180-1]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite most anarchists' tactical disagreement with propaganda by  deed, few would consider it to be terrorism or rule out assassination  under all circumstances. Bombing a village during a war because there  <b>might</b> be an enemy in it is terrorism, whereas assassinating a murdering  dictator or head of a repressive state is defence at best and revenge  at worst. As anarchists have long pointed out, if by terrorism it is  meant "killing innocent people" then the state is the greatest terrorist  of them all (as well as having the biggest bombs and other weapons of destruction available on the planet). If the people committing "acts  of terror" are really anarchists, they would do everything possible  to avoid harming innocent people and never use the statist line that  "collateral damage" is regrettable but inevitable. This is why the vast majority of "propaganda by the deed" acts were directed towards individuals of the ruling class, such as Presidents and Royalty, and were the result of previous acts of state and capitalist violence.</p>
<p>So "terrorist" acts have been committed by anarchists. This is a fact.  However, it has nothing to do with anarchism as a socio-political  theory. As Emma Goldman argued, it was <i>"not Anarchism, as such, but  the brutal slaughter of the eleven steel workers [that] was the urge  for Alexander Berkman's act."</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 268] Equally, members of  <b>other</b> political and religious groups have also committed such acts.  As the Freedom Group of London argued:</p>
<blockquote><p><i> "There is a truism that the man [or woman] in the street seems  always to forget, when he is abusing the Anarchists, or whatever party happens to be his <b>bete noire</b> for the moment, as the  cause of some outrage just perpetrated. This indisputable fact is that homicidal outrages have, from time immemorial, been the reply of goaded and desperate classes, and goaded and desperate individuals, to wrongs from their fellowmen [and women], which they felt to be intolerable. Such acts are  the violent recoil from violence, whether aggressive or repressive . . . their cause lies not in any special  conviction, but in the depths of . . . human nature  itself. The whole course of history, political and social, is strewn with evidence of this."</i> [quoted by Emma Goldman,  <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 259]
</p></blockquote>
<p>Terrorism has been used by many other political, social and  religious groups and parties. For example, Christians, Marxists,  Hindus, Nationalists, Republicans, Moslems, Sikhs, Fascists,  Jews and Patriots have all committed acts of terrorism. Few of these  movements or ideas have been labelled as "terrorist by nature" or  continually associated with violence -- which shows anarchism's  threat to the status quo. There is nothing more likely to discredit  and marginalise an idea than for malicious and/or ill-informed  persons to portray those who believe and practice it as  "mad bombers" with no opinions or ideals at all, just an  insane urge to destroy.</p>
<p>Of course, the vast majority of Christians and so on have opposed terrorism  as morally repugnant and counter-productive. As have the vast majority of   anarchists, at all times and places. However, it seems that in our case   it is necessary to state our opposition to terrorism time and time again.</p>
<p>So, to summarise - only a small minority of terrorists have ever been  anarchists, and only a small minority of anarchists have ever been  terrorists. The anarchist movement as a whole has always recognised that  social relationships cannot be assassinated or bombed out of existence.  Compared to the violence of the state and capitalism, anarchist violence is a drop in the ocean. Unfortunately most people remember the acts of the few anarchists who have committed violence rather than the acts of violence and repression by the state and capital that prompted those acts.</p>

<h2>A.2.19 What ethical views do anarchists hold?</h2>
<p>Anarchist viewpoints on ethics vary considerably, although all share a common belief in the need for an individual to develop within themselves their own sense of ethics. All anarchists agree with Max Stirner that an individual must free themselves from the confines of existing morality and question that morality -- <i>"I decide whether it is the <b>right thing</b> for me; there is no right <b>outside</b> me."</i> [<b>The Ego and Its Own</b>, p. 189]</p>
<p>Few anarchists, however, would go so far as Stirner and reject <b>any</b> concept of social ethics at all (saying that, Stirner does value some universal concepts although they are egoistic ones). Such extreme moral relativism  is almost as bad as moral absolutism for most anarchists (moral relativism  is the view that there is no right or wrong beyond what suits an individual  while moral absolutism is that view that what is right and wrong is independent of what individuals think).</p>
<p>It is often claimed that modern society is breaking up because of excessive  "egoism" or moral relativism. This is false. As far as moral relativism goes, this is a step forward from the moral absolutism urged upon society by various  Moralists and true-believers because it bases itself, however slimly, upon the idea of individual reason. However, as it denies the existence (or  desirability) of ethics it is but the mirror image of what it is rebelling  against. Neither option empowers the individual or is liberating.</p>
<p>Consequently, both of these attitudes hold enormous attraction to authoritarians, as a populace that is either unable to form an opinion about things (and will tolerate anything) or who blindly follow the commands of  the ruling elite are of great value to those in power. Both are rejected by  most anarchists in favour of an evolutionary approach to ethics based upon  human reason to develop the ethical concepts and interpersonal empathy to  generalise these concepts into ethical attitudes within society as well as  within individuals. An anarchistic approach to ethics therefore shares the critical individual investigation implied in moral relativism but grounds itself into common feelings of right and wrong. As Proudhon argued:</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>"All progress begins by abolishing something; every reform rests upon denunciation of some abuse; each new idea is based upon the proved insufficiency of the old idea."</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Most anarchists take the viewpoint that ethical standards, like life itself, are in a constant process of evolution. This leads them to reject the various notions of <i>"God's Law,"</i> <i>"Natural Law,"</i> and so on in favour of a theory of  ethical development based upon the idea that individuals are entirely  empowered to question and assess the world around them -- in fact, they  require it in order to be truly free. You cannot be an anarchist and blindly  accept <b>anything</b>! Michael Bakunin, one of the founding anarchist thinkers,  expressed this radical scepticism as so:</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>"No theory, no ready-made system, no book that has ever been written will save the world. I cleave to no system. I am a true seeker."</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Any system of ethics which is not based on individual questioning can only be authoritarian. Erich Fromm explains why:</p>
<blockquote><p><i> "Formally, authoritarian ethics denies man's capacity to know what is  good or bad; the norm giver is always an authority transcending the  individual. Such a system is based not on reason and knowledge but on  awe of the authority and on the subject's feeling of weakness and  dependence; the surrender of decision making to the authority results  from the latter's magic power; its decisions can not and must not be  questioned. <b>Materially</b>, or according to content, authoritarian ethics answers the question of what is good or bad primarily in terms of the  interests of the authority, not the interests of the subject; it is  exploitative, although the subject may derive considerable benefits,  psychic or material, from it."</i> [<b>Man For Himself</b>, p. 10]   </p></blockquote>
<p>Therefore Anarchists take, essentially, a scientific approach to problems.  Anarchists arrive at ethical judgements without relying on the mythology of  spiritual aid, but on the merits of their own minds. This is done through  logic and reason, and is a far better route to resolving moral questions  than obsolete, authoritarian systems like orthodox religion and certainly  better than the "there is no wrong or right" of moral relativism.</p>
<p>So, what are the source of ethical concepts? For Kropotkin, <i>"nature has thus  to be recognised as the <b>first ethical teacher of man.</b> The social instinct, innate in men as well as in all the social animals, - this is the origin of all ethical conceptions and all subsequent development of morality."</i> [<b>Ethics</b>, p. 45]</p>
<p>Life, in other words, is the basis of anarchist ethics. This means that,  essentially (according to anarchists), an individual's ethical viewpoints  are derived from three basic sources:</p>
<blockquote><p> 1) from the society an individual lives in. As Kropotkin pointed out,  <i>"Man's conceptions of morality are completely dependent upon the form that  their social life assumed at a given time in a given locality . . . this  [social life] is reflected in the moral conceptions of men and in the moral  teachings of the given epoch."</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 315] In other words, experience  of life and of living.</p>
<p>2) A critical evaluation by individuals of their society's ethical norms, as indicated above. This is the core of Erich Fromm's argument that <i>"Man  must accept the responsibility for himself and the fact that only using his  own powers can he give meaning to his life . . .<b>there is no meaning to life  except the meaning man gives his life by the unfolding of his powers, by  living productively.</b>"</i> [<b>Man for Himself</b>, p. 45] In other words, individual thought and development.</p>
<p>3) The feeling of empathy - <i>"the true origin of the moral sentiment . . .  [is] simply in the feeling of sympathy."</i> [<i>"Anarchist Morality"</i>, <b>Anarchism</b>, p. 94] In other words, an individual's ability to  feel and share experiences and concepts with others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This last factor is very important for the development of a sense of ethics. As Kropotkin argued, <i>"[t]he more powerful your imagination, the  better you can picture to yourself what any being feels when it is made  to suffer, and the more intense and delicate will your moral sense be. . . And the more you are accustomed by circumstances, by those surrounding you,  or by the intensity of your own thought and your imagination, to <b>act</b> as  your own thought and imagination urge, the more will the moral sentiment grow  in you, the more will it became habitual."</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 95]</p>
<p>So, anarchism is based (essentially) upon the ethical maxim <i>"treat others as you would like them to treat you under similar circumstances."</i> Anarchists are neither egoists nor altruists when it come to moral stands, they are simply <b>human.</b></p>
<p>As Kropotkin noted, <i>"egoism"</i> and <i>"altruism"</i> both have their roots in the  same motive -- <i>"however great the difference between the two actions in  their result of humanity, the motive is the same. It is the quest for  pleasure."</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 85]</p>
<p>For anarchists, a person's sense of ethics must be developed by themselves and requires the full use of an individual's mental abilities as part of a social grouping, as part of a community. As capitalism and other forms of  authority weaken the individual's imagination and reduce the number of  outlets for them to exercise their reason under the dead weight of hierarchy  as well as disrupting community, little wonder that life under capitalism  is marked by a stark disregard for others and lack of ethical behaviour.</p>
<p>Combined with these factors is the role played by inequality within  society. Without equality, there can be no real ethics for <i>"Justice  implies Equality. . . only those who consider <b>others</b> as their <b>equals</b> can obey the rule: 'Do not do to others what you do not wish  them to do to you.' A serf-owner and a slave merchant can evidently not recognise . . . the 'categorial imperative' [of treating people as ends in themselves and not as means] as regards serfs [or slaves] because they do not look upon them as equals."</i> Hence the <i>"greatest obstacle to the maintenance of a certain moral level in our present societies lies in the absence of social equality. Without <b>real</b> equality, the sense of justice can never be universally developed, because <b>Justice implies the recognition of Equality.</b>"</i> [Peter Kropotkin, <b>Evolution and Environment</b>, p. 88 and p. 79]</p>
<p>Capitalism, like any society, gets the ethical behaviour it deserves..</p>
<p>In a society which moves between moral relativism and absolutism it is  little wonder that egoism becomes confused with egotism. By disempowering individuals from developing their own ethical ideas and instead encouraging blind obedience to external authority (and so moral relativism once  individuals think that they are without that authority's power), capitalist society ensures an impoverishment of individuality and ego. As Erich Fromm puts it:</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>"The failure of modern culture lies not in its principle of  individualism, not in the idea that moral virtue is the same as  the pursuit of self-interest, but in the deterioration of the  meaning of self-interest; not in the fact that people are <b>too  much concerned with their self-interest,</b> but that they are <b>not  concerned enough with the interest of their real self; not in   the fact that they are too selfish, but that they do not love  themselves.</b>"</i> [<b>Man for Himself</b>, p. 139]
</p></blockquote>
<p>Therefore, strictly speaking, anarchism is based upon an egoistic frame of reference - ethical ideas must be an expression of what gives us pleasure as a whole individual (both rational and emotional, reason and empathy). This leads all anarchists to reject the false division between egoism and altruism and recognise that what many people (for example, capitalists) call "egoism" results in individual self-negation and a reduction of individual self-interest. As Kropotkin argues:</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>"What was it that morality, evolving in animal and human societies, was striving for, if not for the opposition to the promptings of narrow egoism, and bringing up humanity in the spirit of the development of altruism? The very expressions 'egoism' and 'altruism' are incorrect, because there can be no pure altruism without an admixture of personal pleasure - and consequently, without egoism. It would therefore be more nearly correct to say that ethics aims at <b>the development of social habits and the weakening of the narrowly personal habits.</b> These last make the individual lose sight of society through his regard for his own person, and therefore they even fail to attain their object, i.e. the welfare of the individual, whereas the development of habits of work in common, and of mutual aid in general, leads to a series of beneficial consequences in the family as well as society."</i> [<b>Ethics</b>, pp. 307-8]
</p></blockquote>
<p>Therefore anarchism is based upon the rejection of moral absolutism (i.e. <i>"God's Law,"</i> <i>"Natural Law,"</i> <i>"Man's Nature,"</i>  <i>"A is A"</i>) and the  narrow egotism which moral relativism so easily lends itself to. Instead,  anarchists recognise that there exists concepts of right and wrong which  exist outside of an individual's evaluation of their own acts.</p>
<p>This is because of the social nature of humanity. The interactions between individuals do develop into a social maxim which, according to Kropotkin, can be summarised as <i>"[i]s it useful to society? Then it is good. Is it hurtful? Then it is bad."</i>  Which acts human beings think of as right or wrong is not, however, unchanging and the  <i>"estimate of what is useful or harmful . . . changes, but the foundation remains the same."</i> [<i>"Anarchist Morality"</i>, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 91 and p. 92]</p>
<p>This sense of empathy, based upon a critical mind, is the fundamental basis of social ethics - the 'what-should-be' can be seen as an ethical criterion for the truth or validity of an objective 'what-is.' So, while recognising  the root of ethics in nature, anarchists consider ethics as fundamentally a <b>human</b> idea - the product of life, thought and evolution created by  individuals and generalised by social living and community.</p>
<p>So what, for anarchists, is unethical behaviour? Essentially anything that denies the most precious achievement of history: the liberty, uniqueness and dignity of the individual.</p>
<p>Individuals can see what actions are unethical because, due to empathy, they  can place themselves into the position of those suffering the behaviour. Acts which restrict individuality can be considered unethical for two  (interrelated) reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, the protection and development of individuality in all enriches the life of every individual and it gives pleasure to individuals because of the diversity it produces. This egoist basis of ethics reinforces the second (social) reason, namely that individuality is good for society for  it enriches the community and social life, strengthening it and allowing  it to grow and evolve. As Bakunin constantly argued, progress is marked by a movement from <i>"the simple to the complex"</i> or, in the words of Herbert Read, it <i>"is measured by the degree of differentiation within a society. If the individual is a unit in a corporate mass, his [or her] life will be  limited, dull, and mechanical. If the individual is a unit on his [or her]  own, with space and potentiality for separate action . . .he can develop - develop in the only real meaning of the word - develop in consciousness of strength, vitality, and joy."</i> [<i>"The Philosophy of Anarchism,"</i>  <b>Anarchy and Order</b>, p. 37]</p>
<p>This defence of individuality is learned from nature. In an ecosystem,  diversity is strength and so biodiversity becomes a source of basic ethical  insight. In its most basic form, it provides a guide to <i>"help us distinguish  which of our actions serve the thrust of natural evolution and which of them  impede them."</i> [Murray Bookchin, <b>The Ecology of Freedom</b>, p. 442]</p>
<p>So, the ethical concept <i>"lies in the feeling of sociality, inherent in the  entire animal world and in the conceptions of equity, which constitutes one  of the fundamental primary judgements of human reason."</i> Therefore anarchists embrace <i>"the permanent presence of a <b>double tendency</b> - towards greater development on the one side, of <b>sociality</b>, and, on the  other side, of a consequent increase of the intensity of life which results  in an increase of happiness for the <b>individuals</b>, and in progress -  physical, intellectual, and moral."</i> [Kropotkin, <b>Ethics</b>, pp. 311-2 and pp. 19-20]</p>
<p>Anarchist attitudes to authority, the state, capitalism, private property  and so on all come from our ethical belief that the liberty of individuals  is of prime concern and that our ability to empathise with others,  to see ourselves in others (our basic equality and common individuality,  in other words).</p>
<p>Thus anarchism combines the subjective evaluation by individuals of a given set of circumstances and actions with the drawing of objective interpersonal  conclusions of these evaluations based upon empathic bounds and discussion  between equals. Anarchism is based on a humanistic approach to ethical  ideas, one that evolves along with society and individual development. Hence an <b>ethical</b> society is one in which <i>"[d]ifference among people will be respected, indeed fostered, as elements that enrich the unity of  experience and phenomenon . . . [the different] will be conceived of as  individual parts of a whole all the richer because of its complexity."</i>  [Murray Bookchin, <b>Post Scarcity Anarchism</b>, p. 82]</p>

<h2>A.2.20 Why are most anarchists atheists?</h2>
<p>It is a fact that most anarchists are atheists. They reject the idea of god and oppose all forms of religion, particularly organised religion. Today, in secularised western European countries, religion has lost  its once dominant place in society. This often makes the militant  atheism of anarchism seem strange. However, once the negative role  of religion is understood the importance of libertarian atheism  becomes obvious. It is because of the role of religion and its  institutions that anarchists have spent some time refuting the idea  of religion as well as propagandising against it.</p>
<p>So why do so many anarchists embrace atheism? The simplest answer  is that most anarchists are atheists because it is a logical extension  of anarchist ideas. If anarchism is the rejection of illegitimate  authorities, then it follows that it is the rejection of the so-called  Ultimate Authority, God. Anarchism is grounded in reason, logic, and  scientific thinking, not religious thinking. Anarchists tend to be  sceptics, and not believers. Most anarchists consider the Church to  be steeped in hypocrisy and the Bible a work of fiction, riddled with  contradictions, absurdities and horrors. It is notorious in its  debasement of women and its sexism is infamous. Yet men are treated  little better. Nowhere in the bible is there an acknowledgement that  human beings have inherent rights to life, liberty, happiness, dignity,  fairness, or self-government. In the bible, humans are sinners, worms,  and slaves (figuratively and literally, as it condones slavery). God  has all the rights, humanity is nothing.</p>
<p>This is unsurprisingly, given the nature of religion. Bakunin put it  best:</p>
<blockquote><p><i> "<b>The idea of God implies the abdication of human reason and justice; it is the most decisive negation of human liberty, and necessarily ends in the enslavement of mankind, both in theory and in practice.</b></i> </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><i> "Unless, then, we desire the enslavement and degradation of mankind . . . we may not, must not make the slightest concession either to the  God of theology or to the God of metaphysics. He who, in this mystical alphabet, begins with A will inevitably end with Z; he who desires to worship God must harbour no childish illusions about the matter, but bravely renounce his liberty and humanity.</i> </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><i> "If God is, man is a slave; now, man can and must be free; then, God  does not exist."</i> [<b>God and the State</b>, p. 25] </p></blockquote>
<p>For most anarchists, then, atheism is required due to the nature of religion. <i>"To proclaim as divine all that is grand, just, noble, and beautiful in humanity,"</i> Bakunin argued, <i>"is to tacitly admit that  humanity of itself would have been unable to produce it -- that is,  that, abandoned to itself, its own nature is miserable, iniquitous, base, and ugly. Thus we come back to the essence of all religion --  in other words, to the disparagement of humanity for the greater  glory of divinity."</i> As such, to do justice to our humanity and the  potential it has, anarchists argue that we must do without the  harmful myth of god and all it entails and so on behalf of <i>"human  liberty, dignity, and prosperity, we believe it our duty to recover  from heaven the goods which it has stolen and return them to earth."</i>  [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 37 and p. 36]</p>
<p>As well as the theoretical degrading of humanity and its liberty,  religion has other, more practical, problems with it from an  anarchist point of view. Firstly, religions have been a source of inequality and oppression. Christianity (like Islam), for example,  has always been a force for repression whenever it holds any  political or social sway (believing you have a direct line to god  is a sure way of creating an authoritarian society). The Church  has been a force of social repression, genocide, and the  justification for every tyrant for nearly two millennia. When given the chance it has ruled as cruelly as any monarch or dictator. This is unsurprising:</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>"God being everything, the real world and man are nothing. God being truth, justice, goodness, beauty, power and life, man is falsehood, iniquity, evil, ugliness, impotence, and death. God being master, man is the slave. Incapable of finding justice, truth, and eternal life by his own effort, he can attain them only through a divine revelation. But whoever says revelation, says revealers, messiahs, prophets, priests, and legislators inspired by God himself; and these, as the holy instructors of humanity, chosen by God himself to direct it in the path of salvation, necessarily exercise absolute power. All men owe them passive and unlimited obedience; for against the divine reason there is no human reason, and against the justice of God no terrestrial justice holds."</i> [Bakunin, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 24] </p></blockquote>
<p>Christianity has only turned tolerant and peace-loving when it is  powerless and even then it has continued its role as apologist for  the powerful. This is the second reason why anarchists oppose the church for when not being the source of oppression, the church has justified it and ensured its continuation. It has kept the working  class in bondage for generations by sanctioning the rule of earthly  authorities and teaching working people that it is wrong to fight  against those same authorities. Earthly rulers received their  legitimisation from the heavenly lord, whether political (claiming  that rulers are in power due to god's will) or economic (the rich  having been rewarded by god). The bible praises obedience, raising  it to a great virtue. More recent innovations like the Protestant  work ethic also contribute to the subjugation of working people.</p>
<p>That religion is used to further the interests of the powerful can  quickly be seen from most of history. It conditions the oppressed  to humbly accept their place in life by urging the oppressed to be  meek and await their reward in heaven. As Emma Goldman argued,  Christianity (like religion in general) <i>"contains nothing dangerous  to the regime of authority and wealth; it stands for self-denial  and self-abnegation, for penance and regret, and is absolutely  inert in the face of every [in]dignity, every outrage imposed upon  mankind."</i> [<b>Red Emma Speaks</b>, p. 234]</p>
<p>Thirdly, religion has always been a conservative force in society. This is unsurprising, as it bases itself not on investigation and analysis of the real world but rather in repeating the truths  handed down from above and contained in a few holy books. Theism is then <i>"the theory of speculation"</i> while atheism is <i>"the science  of demonstration."</i> The <i>"one hangs in the metaphysical clouds of the  Beyond, while the other has its roots firmly in the soil. It is the  earth, not heaven, which man must rescue if he is truly to be saved."</i> Atheism, then, <i>"expresses the expansion and growth of the human mind"</i> while theism <i>"is static and fixed."</i> It is <i>"the absolutism of theism,  its pernicious influence upon humanity, its paralysing effect upon  thought and action, which Atheism is fighting with all its power."</i> [Emma Goldman, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 243, p. 245 and pp. 246-7]</p>
<p>As the Bible says, <i>"By their fruits shall ye know them."</i> We anarchists  agree but unlike the church we apply this truth to religion as well.  That is why we are, in the main, atheists. We recognise the destructive  role played by the Church, and the harmful effects of organised  monotheism, particularly Christianity, on people. As Goldman summaries,  religion <i>"is the conspiracy of ignorance against reason, of darkness  against light, of submission and slavery against independence and  freedom; of the denial of strength and beauty, against the affirmation  of the joy and glory of life."</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 240]</p>
<p>So, given the fruits of the Church, anarchists argue that it is time  to uproot it and plant new trees, the trees of reason and liberty.</p>
<p>That said, anarchists do not deny that religions contain important  ethical ideas or truths. Moreover, religions can be the base for  strong and loving communities and groups. They can offer a sanctuary  from the alienation and oppression of everyday life and offer a guide  to action in a world where everything is for sale. Many aspects of,  say, Jesus' or Buddha's life and teachings are inspiring and worth  following. If this were not the case, if religions were simply a tool  of the powerful, they would have long ago been rejected. Rather,  they have a dual-nature in that contain both ideas necessary to live  a good life as well as apologetics for power. If they did not, the  oppressed would not believe and the powerful would suppress them  as dangerous heresies.</p>
<p>And, indeed, repression has been the fate of any group that has preached a radical message. In the middle ages numerous  revolutionary Christian movements and sects were crushed by  the earthly powers that be with the firm support of the  mainstream church. During the Spanish Civil War the Catholic  church supported Franco's fascists, denouncing the killing of  pro-Franco priests by supporters of the republic while remaining  silent about Franco's murder of Basque priests who had supported  the democratically elected government (Pope John Paul II is  seeking to turn the dead pro-Franco priests into saints while  the pro-Republican priests remain unmentioned). The Archbishop  of El Salvador, Oscar Arnulfo Romero, started out as a conservative  but after seeing the way in which the political and economic  powers were exploiting the people became their outspoken champion.  He was assassinated by right-wing paramilitaries in 1980 because  of this, a fate which has befallen many other supporters of liberation theology, a radical interpretation of the Gospels which  tries to reconcile socialist ideas and Christian social thinking.</p>
<p>Nor does the anarchist case against religion imply that religious people do not take part in social struggles to improve society.  Far from it. Religious people, including members of the church  hierarchy, played a key role in the US civil rights movement of  the 1960s. The religious belief within Zapata's army of peasants  during the Mexican revolution did not stop anarchists taking part  in it (indeed, it had already been heavily influenced by the ideas of anarchist militant Ricardo Flores Magon). It is the dual-nature of religion which explains why many popular movements and revolts (particularly by peasants) have used the rhetoric of religion, seeking to keep the good aspects of their faith will fighting the earthly injustice its official representatives sanctify. For anarchists, it is the willingness  to fight against injustice which counts, not whether someone believes  in god or not. We just think that the social role of religion is to  dampen down revolt, not encourage it. The tiny number of radical  priests compared to those in the mainstream or on the right  suggests the validity of our analysis.</p>
<p>It should be stressed that anarchists, while overwhelmingly hostile to  the idea of the Church and an established religion, do not object to  people practising religious belief on their own or in groups, so long  as that practice doesn't impinge on the liberties of others. For example,  a cult that required human sacrifice or slavery would be antithetical to  anarchist ideas, and would be opposed. But peaceful systems of belief  could exist in harmony within in anarchist society. The anarchist view  is that religion is a personal matter, above all else -- if people want  to believe in something, that's their business, and nobody else's as  long as they do not impose those ideas on others. All we can do is  discuss their ideas and try and convince them of their errors.</p>
<p>To end, it should noted that we are not suggesting that atheism  is somehow mandatory for an anarchist. Far from it. As we discuss  in <a href="secA3.html#seca37">section A.3.7</a>, there are anarchists who do believe in god or some  form of religion. For example, Tolstoy combined libertarian ideas  with a devote Christian belief. His ideas, along with Proudhon's,  influences the Catholic Worker organisation, founded by anarchists Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin in 1933 and still active today. The  anarchist activist Starhawk, active in the current anti-globalisation  movement, has no problems also being a leading Pagan. However, for most  anarchists, their ideas lead them logically to atheism for, as Emma  Goldman put it, <i>"in its negation of gods is at the same time the  strongest affirmation of man, and through man, the eternal yea to  life, purpose, and beauty."</i> [<b>Red Emma Speaks</b>, p. 248]</p>
