<title>Appendix : Anarchism and &quot;anarcho&quot;-capitalism</title>

<h1>Appendix : Anarchism and &quot;anarcho&quot;-capitalism</h1>
<p>This appendix exists for one reason, namely to explain why the idea of &quot;anarcho&quot;-capitalism is a bogus one. While we have covered this topic in <a href="secFcon.html">section F</a>, we thought that this appendix should be created in order to discuss in more detail why anarchists reject both &quot;anarcho&quot;-capitalism and its claims to being anarchist.</p>
<p>This appendix has three parts. The first two sections are our critique of  Bryan Caplan's &quot;anarcho&quot;-capitalist <a href="http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/anarfaq.htm">&quot;Anarchist Theory FAQ.&quot;</a> Caplan's FAQ is  the main on-line attempt to give the oxymoron of &quot;anarcho&quot;-capitalism some  form of justification and so it is worthwhile explaining, using his FAQ as  the base, why such an attempt fails. The last part of this appendix is the original version of <a href="secFcon.html">section F</a>,</p>
<p>As we will prove, Caplan's FAQ fails in its attempt to show that &quot;anarcho&quot; capitalism can be considered as part of the anarchist movement and in fact his  account involves extensive re-writing of history. This appendix is in two  parts, a reply to Caplan's most recent FAQ release (version 5.2) and an  older reply to version 4.1.1 (which was originally section F.10 of the FAQ). The <a href="append12.html">introduction</a> to the reply to version 4.1.1 indicates what most anarchists think of Caplan's FAQ and its claims of &quot;objectivity&quot; as so we will not repeat ourselves here.</p>
<p>We decided to replace the original version of section F with an edited  version simply because the original section was too long in respect to  the rest of the FAQ. While  this FAQ may have started out as a rebuttal to &quot;anarcho&quot;-capitalist  claims of being anarchist, it no longer is. As such, in an <b><i>anarchist</i></b>   FAQ section F became redundant as &quot;anarcho&quot;-capitalism is a fringe  ideology even within the USA. If it were not for their presence on  the web and some academics taking their claims to being anarchists  at face value, we would only mention them in passing.</p>
<p>We have decided to include this appendix as it is really an addition to  the main body of the FAQ. Parties interested in why &quot;anarcho&quot;-capitalist claims are false can explore this appendix, those who are  interested in anarchist politics can read the FAQ without having to also  read too many arguments between anarchists and capitalists. We should,  perhaps, thank Caplan for allowing us an opportunity of explaining the  ideas of such people as Proudhon and Tucker, allowing us to quote them  and so bring their ideas to a wider audience and for indicating that  anarchism, in all its forms, has always opposed capitalism and always will.</p>
