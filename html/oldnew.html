<h1>Introduction</h1>
</div>
Here is a list of all the new additions to the FAQ. An list of older 
changes can found <a href="oldernew.html">here</a>.
<p>
The version number of the FAQ changes as follows. A major change
results in then the version number is increased by one (from version 
10.2 to version 11, for example). If a minor change is being made 
then the current version is increased by 0.1 (for example,
from version 10.2 to 10.3).
<p>
As far as new anarchist and libertarian links are concerned, we will add them
when we get enough to make an update worthwhile. These updates have no 
effect on the FAQ version number as we don't want to inflate it higher than 
the content deserves.
<p>
We hope that this makes it clear to visitors!

<h1><a href="10years.html">Tenth Anniversary of An Anarchist FAQ!</a></h1>

<a href="secCint.html">Section C</a>
<br>Revised introduction to Section C

<p>
<a href="secC1.html">Section C.1</a>
<br>Totally revised and expanded revision of section
C.1, now entitled <i><b>"What is wrong with Economics?"</b></i>. 
Explains why mainstream economics is not a science and not value
free as well as how it presents a radically false picture of
capitalism.
</p>

<p>
<a href="secC2.html">Section C.2</a>
<br>Totally revised and expanded revision of section
C.2, now entitled <i><b>" Why is capitalism exploitative?"</b></i>. 
Explains why anarchists, like other socialists, think capitalism 
is exploitative. It also critiques many of the standard mainstream 
economics defences of profit, interest and rent (such as marginal
productivity theory, waiting, risk and innovation).
</p>

<a href="secC9.html#secc91">Section C.9.1</a>
<br>Addition to the section on <i><b>"Would cutting wages reduce unemployment?"</b></i>
to note that there is no theoretical or empirical reason to support the standard economic 
assertion of an upward sloping supply curve for labour and so its arguments on what causes
unemployment (i.e. wages being too high).

<a href="secFcon.html">Section F</a>
<br>New, smaller, section on "anarcho"-capitalism is not anarchism. 
This is an edited version of the original section F (which has been
put into an appendix).
<p>
<a href="append13.html">Appendix -- Is "anarcho"-capitalism a type of anarchism?</a>
<br>The old section F (with some very slight changes here and there).
<p>
This is part of the process of getting the FAQ ready for being 
published by AK Press. Not only does this change mean that the AK
Press proof-readers have less to look at, it puts "anarcho"-capitalism 
more into context. If it were not for some academics taking their
claims at face value, this section would not even be needed.

<a href="secF7.html">Section F.7</a>
<br>New section on the history of "anarcho"-capitalism and how it
always (rightly) rejected the term "anarchist." Discusses how a
"right-wing anarchism" is impossible (it would just be rule by 
the rich).
<p>
<a href="secF11.html">Section F.11</a>
<br>The old section F.7 (on "Natural Law")
<p>
<a href="secF9.html">Section F.9</a>
<br>Yet more evidence on why Viking Iceland was not an 
"anarcho"-capitalist system. As far as it was anarchic, it
was not capitalist. As it became capitalistic, it became 
statist.
<p>
<a href="secF1.html">Section F.1</a>
<br>A rewrite of the first section to summarise the rest of the
section F to show how "anarcho"-capitalism's own definition of 
the state refutes its claim to be anarchist.
<p>
<a href="secF1.html#secf14">Section F.1.4</a>
<br>Some of what was originally in section F.1, plus some new bits 
and pieces on how individualist anarchism is <b>not</b> really related to 
"anarcho"-capitalism.
<p>
<a href="secF2.html#secf26">Section F.2.6</a>
<br>A few changes on right "libertarian" support for voluntary
slavery and how its exposes its contradictions.
<p>
<a href="secFint.html">Section F --Introduction</a>
<br>Slight change to the introduction to Section F
<p>
<a href="secF1.html#secf13">Section F.1.3</a>
<br>A few additions on the non-scientific nature of most kinds
of right-wing libertarianism and how it produces authoritarian
politics.
<p>
This is part of the process of getting the FAQ ready for being 
published by AK Press. The next stage will be moving section F
into an appendix and replacing it with a much more edited version.
This because "anarcho"-capitalism is not important and it takes
up too much space in an FAQ about anarchism.
