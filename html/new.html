<h1>Introduction</h1>
</div>
<p>Here is a list of all the new additions to the FAQ. An list of older  changes can found <a href="oldnew.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The version number of the FAQ changes as follows. A major change results in then the version number is increased by one (from version  10.2 to version 11, for example). If a minor change is being made  then the current version is increased by 0.1 (for example, from version 10.2 to 10.3).</p>
<p>As far as new anarchist and libertarian links are concerned, we will add them when we get enough to make an update worthwhile. These updates have no  effect on the FAQ version number as we don't want to inflate it higher than  the content deserves.</p>
<p>We hope that this makes it clear to visitors!</p>
