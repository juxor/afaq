<h2>An Anarchist FAQ Webpage Contacts</h2>
</div>

This web-site is the creation of many anarchists across the globe and
is a classic example of the power of freedom, equality and mutual aid.
<p>
It is produced by a <a href="intro.html">small collective of people</a> 
who work on the FAQ when we can (mostly in our free time, after work). 
This means that any e-mail sent may take a while to be replied to. We 
apologise for any delay, but we are not a corporate funded think-tank 
or full-time members of a party apparatus. We hope you understand.
<p>
If you want to contact some of those responsible, then send email to  
<a href="mailto:anarchistfaq@yahoo.co.uk">anarchistfaq@yahoo.co.uk
