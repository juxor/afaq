<h1>What caused the degeneration of the Russian Revolution?</h1>
<p>As is well known, the Russian Revolution failed. Rather than  produce socialism, the Bolshevik revolution gave birth to an autocratic party dictatorship residing over a state capitalist economy. In turn, this regime gave rise to the horrors of  Stalin's system. While Stalinism was denounced by all genuine  socialists, a massive debate has existed within the Marxist movement over when, exactly, the Russian Revolution failed  and why it did. Some argue around 1924, others say around 1928, some (libertarian Marxists) argue from the Bolshevik seizure of power. The reasons for the failure tend to be more readily  agreed upon: isolation, the economic and social costs of civil  war, the <i>&quot;backward&quot;</i> nature of Russian society and economy are usually listed as the key factors. Moreover, what the Stalinist  regime was is also discussed heatedly in such circles. Some (orthodox Trotskyists) claiming it was a <i>&quot;degenerated workers state,&quot;</i> others (such as the neo-Trotskyist UK SWP) that it was <i>&quot;state capitalist.&quot;</i></p>
<p>For anarchists, however, the failure of Bolshevism did not come as a surprise. In fact, just as with the reformist fate of the  Social Democrats, the failure of the Russian Revolution provided empirical evidence for Bakunin's critique of Marx. As Emma Goldman recounts in her memoirs</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>&quot;Professor Harold Laski . . . expressed the opinion that I ought to take some comfort in the vindication anarchism had received  by the Bolsheviki. I agreed, adding that not only their regime,  but their stepbrothers as well, the Socialists in power in  other countries, had demonstrated the failure of the Marxian State better than any anarchist argument. Living proof was always more convincing than theory.  Naturally I did not regret the Socialist failure but I could not rejoice in it in the face of the Russian tragedy.&quot;</i> [<b>Living My Life</b>, vol. 2, p. 969]  </p></blockquote>
<p>Given that Leninists claim that the Russian revolution was a  success (at least initially) and so proves the validity of  their ideology, anarchists have a special duty to analysis and understand what went wrong. Simply put, if the Russian Revolution was a &quot;success,&quot; Leninism does not need &quot;failures&quot;!</p>
<p>This section of the FAQ will discuss these explanations for the failure of Bolshevism. Simply put, anarchists are not convinced  by Leninist explanations on why Bolshevism created a new class  system, not socialism.</p>
<p>This subject is very important. Unless we learn the lessons of history we will be doomed to repeat them. Given the fact that  many people who become interested in socialist ideas will come across the remnants of Leninist parties it is important that  anarchists explains clearly and convincingly why the Russian  Revolution failed and the role of Bolshevik ideology in that process. We need to account why a popular revolution became  in a few short years a state capitalist party dictatorship. As Noam Chomsky put it:</p>
<blockquote><p><i> &quot;In the stages leading up to the Bolshevik coup in October 1917, there <b>were</b> incipient socialist institutions developing in  Russia -- workers' councils, collectives, things like that.  And they survived to an extent once the Bolsheviks took over -- but not for very long; Lenin and Trotsky pretty much  eliminated them as they consolidated their power. I mean, you can argue about the <b>justification</b> for eliminating them, but the fact is that the socialist initiatives were pretty quickly eliminated. </i></p>
<p><i>&quot;Now, people who want to justify it say, 'The Bolsheviks had to do it' -- that's the standard justification: Lenin and Trotsky had to do it, because of the contingencies of the  civil war, for survival, there wouldn't have been food  otherwise, this and that. Well, obviously the question is, was that true. To answer that, you've got to look at the  historical facts: I don't think it was true. In fact, I  think the incipient socialist structures in Russia were  dismantles <b>before</b> the really dire conditions arose . . . But reading their own writings, my feeling is that Lenin  and Trotsky knew what they were doing, it was conscious and understandable.&quot;</i> [<b>Understanding Power</b>, p. 226]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we discussed in the appendix on <a href="append41.html">&quot;What happened during the Russian Revolution?&quot;</a>, Chomsky's feelings are more than supported by the historical record. The elimination of meaningful working class freedom and self-management started from the start and was firmly in place before the start of  the civil war at the end of May, 1918. The civil war simply  accelerated processes which had already started, strengthened policies that had already been applied. And it could be argued that rather than impose alien policies onto Bolshevism, the civil war simply brought the hidden (and not-so-hidden) state capitalist and authoritarian politics of Marxism and Leninism to the fore.</p>
<p>Which is why analysing the failure of the revolution is important.  If the various arguments presented by Leninists on why Bolshevism failed (and, consequently, Stalinism developed) can be refuted,  then we are left with the key issues of revolutionary politics --  whether Bolshevik politics had a decisive negative impact on the  development of the Russian Revolution and, if so, there is an alternative to those politics. As regards the first issue, as we discussed in the appendix on <a href="append44.html">&quot;How did Bolshevik ideology contribute to the failure of the   Revolution?&quot;</a>, anarchists argue that this was the case. Bolshevik ideology itself played a key role in the degeneration of the revolution. And as regards the second one, anarchists can point to the example of the Makhnovists, which proves that alternative  policies were possible and could be applied with radically different  outcomes (see the appendix on <a href="append46.html">&quot;Why does the Makhnovist movement show there is an   alternative to Bolshevism?&quot;</a> for more on the Makhnovist movement).</p>
<p>This means that anarchists stress the interplay between the  &quot;objective factors&quot; and the subjective one (i.e. party ideology).  Faced with difficult circumstances, people and parties react in  different ways. If they did not then it would imply what they  thought has no impact at all on their actions. It also means  that the politics of the Bolsheviks played no role in their  decisions. As we discussed in the appendix on  <a href="append41.html">&quot;What happened during the Russian Revolution?&quot;</a>, this position simply cannot be maintained. Leninist ideology itself played a key role in the rise of Stalinism. A conclusion Leninists reject. They,  of course, try to distance themselves from Stalinism, correctly  arguing that it was a brutal and undemocratic system. The  problem is that it was Lenin and Trotsky rather then Stalin  who first shot strikers, banned left papers, radical organisations  and party factions, sent workers and revolutionaries to the gulags,  advocated and introduced one-man management and piece-work in the  workplace, eliminated democracy in the military and shut down  soviets elected with the &quot;wrong&quot; (i.e. non-Bolshevik) delegates.</p>
<p>Many Leninists know nothing of these facts. Their parties simply  do not tell them the whole story of when Lenin and Trotsky were  in power. Others do know and attempt to justify these actions.  When anarchists discuss why the Russian Revolution failed,  these Leninists have basically one reply. They argue that  anarchists never seem to consider the objective forces at play  during the Russian revolution, namely the civil war, the legacy  of World War One, the international armies of counter-revolution  and economic disruption. These <i>&quot;objective factors&quot;</i> meant that the  revolution was, basically, suffocated and where the overriding  contribution to the rise of militarism and the crushing of  democracy within the soviets.</p>
<p>For anarchists such <i>&quot;objective factors&quot;</i> do not (and must not)  explain why the Russian Revolution failed. This is because, as we argue in the following sections, almost all revolutions  will face the same, or similar, problems. Indeed, in sections <a href="append43.html#app1">1</a> and  <a href="append43.html#app2">2</a>  both anarchists like Kropotkin and Marxists  like Lenin argued that this was the case. As we discussed in <a href="secH2.html#sech21">section H.2.1</a>,  Leninists like to claim that they are <i>&quot;realistic&quot;</i> (unlike the <i>&quot;utopian&quot;</i> anarchists) and recognise civil war is inevitable in a revolution. As  <a href="append43.html#app3">section 3</a> indicates, any  defence of Bolshevism based on blaming the impact of the civil war is both factually and logically flawed. As far as economic disruption goes, as we discuss in  <a href="append43.html#app4">section 4</a> this explanation of Bolshevik authoritarianism is unconvincing as <b>every</b> revolution will face this problem. Then  <a href="append43.html#app5">section 5</a> analyses the common  Leninist argument that the revolution failed because the Russian working class became <i>&quot;atomised&quot;</i> or <i>&quot;declassed.&quot;</i> As that section indicates, the Russian working class was more than capable of collective action throughout the 1918 to 1921 period (and beyond). The problem was that it was directed <b>against</b> the Bolshevik party. Finally,  <a href="append43.html#app6">section 6</a> indicates whether the  Bolshevik leaders explained their actions in terms of the  &quot;objective factors&quot; they faced.</p>
<p>It should be stressed that we are discussing this factors individually simply because it is easier to do so. It reality, it is less hard to  do so. For example, civil war will, undoubtedly, mean economic disruption. Economic disruption will mean unemployment and that will affect the  working class via unemployment and less goods available (for example). So just because we separate the specific issues for discussion purposes, it should not be taken to imply that we are not aware of their combined impact on the Russian Revolution.</p>
<p>Of course there is the slight possibility that the failure of Bolshevism can be explained <b>purely</b> in these terms. Perhaps a future revolution will be less destructive, less isolated,  less resisted than the Russian (although, as we noted in the <a href="append43.html#app2">section 2</a>,  leading Bolsheviks like Lenin, Trotsky and Bukharin doubted this). That <b>is</b> a possibility. However, should we embrace an ideology whose basic, underlying, argument is based on the hope that fate will be kinder to them this time? As Lenin argued against the Russian left-communists in early 1918:</p>
<blockquote><p><i> &quot;Yes, we shall see the world revolution, but for the time being it is a very good fairy-tale . . . But I ask, is it proper for a serious revolutionary to believe in fairy-tales? . . . [I]f you tell the  people that civil war will break out in German and also guarantee that instead of a clash with imperialism we shall have a field revolution on a world-wide scale, the people will say you are deceiving them. In doing this you will be overcoming the difficulties with which history has confronted us only in your minds, by your wishes . . . You are staking everything on this card! If the  revolution breaks out, everything is saved . . . But if it does not turn out as we desire, if it does not achieve victory tomorrow -- what then? Then the masses will say to you, you acted like  gamblers -- you staked everything on a fortunate turn of events that did not take place . . .&quot;</i> [<b>Collected Works</b>, vol. 27,  p. 102]  </p></blockquote>
<p>Anarchists have always recognised that a revolution would face problems and difficult &quot;objective factors&quot; and has developed our ideas accordingly. We argue that to blame &quot;objective factors&quot; on the failure of the Russian Revolution simply shows that  believing in fairy-tales is sadly far too common on the &quot;serious&quot; Leninist &quot;revolutionary&quot; left. And as we discuss in  the appendix on <a href="append44.html">&quot;How did Bolshevik ideology contribute to the failure of the   Revolution?&quot;</a>,  the impact of Bolshevik ideology on the failure of the revolution was important and decisive. Even <b>if</b> the next revolution is less destructive, it cannot be argued that socialism will be the result if Bolshevik ideology is reapplied. And as Cornelius Castoriadis argues, <i>&quot;this 'response' [of explaining the failure of the Russian Revolution on &quot;objective factors&quot;] teaches us nothing we could  extend beyond the confines of the Russian situation in 1920. The  sole conclusion to be drawn from this kind of 'analysis' is that  revolutionaries should ardently hope that future revolutions break  out in more advanced countries, that they should not remain  isolated, and that civil wars should not in the least be  devastating.&quot;</i> [<b>The Role of Bolshevik Ideology in the Birth of  the Bureaucracy</b>, p. 92] While this may be sufficient for the followers of Bolshevism, it cannot be sufficient for anyone who wants to learn from history, not to repeat it.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if difficult times back in 1918-21 justified suppressing  working class freedom and self-management, imprisoning and shooting  anarchists and other socialists, implementing and glorifying party dictatorship, what might we expect in difficult times in the future?  Simply put, if your defence of the Bolsheviks rests simply on  &quot;difficult circumstances&quot; then it can only mean one thing, namely  if &quot;difficult circumstances&quot; occur again we can expect the same outcome.</p>
<p>One last point. We should stress that libertarians do not think any future revolution will suffer as terrible conditions as that experienced by the Russian one. However, it might and we need to base our politics on the worse case possibility. That said, we argue that Bolshevik  policies made things worse -- by centralising economic and political power, they automatically hindered the participation of working class people in the revolution, smothering any creative self-activity under the dead-weight of state officialdom. As a libertarian revolution would be based on maximising working class self-activity (at all levels, locally and upwards) we would argue that it would be better placed to respond to even the terrible conditions facing the Russian  Revolution.</p>
<p>That is not all. As we argue in the appendix on <a href="append44.html">&quot;How did Bolshevik ideology contribute to the failure of the Revolution?&quot;</a> we are of the   opinion  that Bolshevism itself undermined the socialist potential of the  revolution, irrespective of the actual circumstances involved  (which, to some degree, will affect <b>any</b> revolution). For example,  the Bolshevik preference for centralisation and nationalisation would negatively affect a revolution conducted in even the best  circumstances, as would the seizure of state power rather than its destruction. As is clear from the appendix on <a href="append44.html">&quot;How did Bolshevik ideology contribute to the failure of the Revolution?&quot;</a>, only the   elimination of what makes Bolshevism Bolshevik would ensure that a revolution would be truly libertarian. So anarchists stress that rather than be forced upon them by <i>&quot;objective factors&quot;</i> many of these policies  were, in fact, in line with pre-civil war Bolshevik ideas. The Bolshevik vision of socialism, in other words, ensured that they smothered the (libertarian) socialist tendencies and institutions  that existed at the time. As Chomsky summarises, <i>&quot;Lenin and Trotsky, shortly after seizing state power in 1917, moved to dismantle organs of popular control, including factory committees and Soviets, thus proceeding to deter and overcome socialist tendencies.&quot;</i> [<b>Deterring Democracy</b>, p. 361] That they <b>thought</b> their system of state capitalism was a form of &quot;socialism&quot; is irrelevant -- they systematically combated (real) socialist  tendencies in favour of state capitalist ones and did so knowingly and deliberately (see sections  <a href="secH3.html#sech31">H.3.1</a> and  <a href="secH3.html#sech313">H.3.13</a> on the differences between real socialism and Marxism in its Bolshevik mode and, of course, <a href="append41.html">&quot;What happened during the Russian Revolution?&quot;</a> on Bolshevik practice itself).</p>
<p>So it is important to stress that even <b>if</b> the Russian Revolution  had occurred in better circumstances, it is unlikely that Bolshevism  would have resulted in socialism rather than state capitalism. Certain  Bolshevik principles ensure that any revolution lead by a vanguard party  would not have succeeded. This can be seen from the experience of Bolshevism immediately after it seized power, before the start of the civil war and major economic collapse. In the circumstances of  post-world war I Russia, these principles were attenuated but their  application in even the best of situations would have undermined  socialist tendencies in the revolution. Simply put, a statist  revolution will have statist, not libertarian, ends.</p>
<p>The focusing on &quot;objective factors&quot; (particularly the civil war)  has become the traditional excuse for people with a romantic  attachment to Leninism but who are unwilling to make a stand  over what the Bolsheviks actually did in power. This excuse is  not viable if you seek to build a revolutionary movement today:  you need to choose between the real path of Lenin and the real,  anarchist, alternative. As Lenin constantly stressed, a revolution  will be difficult -- fooling ourselves about what will happen now  just undermines our chances of success in the future and ensure that history will repeat itself.</p>
<p>Essentially, the &quot;objective factors&quot; argument is not a defence  of Leninism, but rather one that seeks to evade having to make  such a defence. This is very typical of Leninist parties today.  Revolutionary politics would be much better served by confronting  this history and the politics behind it head on. Perhaps, if Leninists did do this, they would probably remain Leninists,  but at least then their party members and those who read their publications would have an understanding of what this meant. And they would have to dump Lenin's <b>State and Revolution</b> into the same place Lenin himself did when in power -- into the rubbish bin -- and admit that democracy and Bolshevik revolution do not go together.</p>
<p>It is precisely these rationalisations for Bolshevism based on  &quot;objective factors&quot; which this section of the FAQ discusses and  refutes. However, it is important to stress that it was <b>not</b>  a case of the Bolshevik regime wanting to introduce communism  but, being isolated, ended up imposing state capitalism instead.  Indeed, the idea that &quot;objective factors&quot; caused the degeneration  of the revolution is only valid if and only if the Bolsheviks were  implementing socialist policies during the period immediately after  the October revolution. That was not the case. Rather than objective  factors undermining socialist policies, the facts of the matter are  that the Bolsheviks pursued a statist and (state) capitalist policy  from the <b>start.</b> As we discuss in the appendix on <a href="append44.html">&quot;How did Bolshevik ideology contribute to the failure of the Revolution?&quot;</a> the likes of   Lenin  explicitly argued for these policies as essential for building  socialism (or, at best, the preconditions of socialism) in Russia and Bolshevik practice flowed from these comments. As we discuss  in more detail in the appendix on <a href="append41.html">&quot;What happened during the Russian Revolution?&quot;</a>, the Bolsheviks happily introduced  authoritarian and state capitalist policies <b>from the start.</b> Many  of the policies denounced as &quot;Stalinist&quot; by Leninists were being  advocated and implemented by Lenin in the spring of 1918, i.e.  before the start of the civil war and massive economic chaos. In other words, the usual excuses for Bolshevik tyranny do not hold much water, both factually and logically -- as this section of the  FAQ seeks to show.</p>
<p>And, ironically, the framework which Leninists use in this discussion  shows the importance of Bolshevik ideology and the key role it played  in the outcome of the revolution. After all, pro-Bolsheviks argue that  the <i>&quot;objective factors&quot;</i> forced the <b>Bolsheviks</b> to act as they did.  However, the proletariat is meant to be the <i>&quot;ruling class&quot;</i> in the  <i>&quot;dictatorship of the proletariat.&quot;</i> As such, to argue that the  Bolsheviks were forced to act as they did due to circumstances means  to implicitly acknowledge that the party held power in Russia,  <b>not</b> the working class. That a ruling party could become a party  dictatorship is not that unsurprising. Nor that <b>its</b> vision of what &quot;socialism&quot; was would be given preference over the desires of the  working class in whose name it ruled.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the discussion on why the Bolshevik party failed shows the validity of Bakunin's critique of Marxism. As he put it:</p>
<blockquote><p><i> &quot;Nor can we comprehend talk of freedom of the proletariat or  true deliverance of the masses within the State and by the State. State signifies domination, and all domination implies subjection of the masses, and as a result, their exploitation to the  advantage of some governing minority. </i></p>
<p><i>&quot;Not even as revolutionary transition will we countenance national Conventions, nor Constituent Assemblies, nor provisional governments, nor so called revolutionary dictatorships: because we are persuaded that revolution is sincere, honest and real only among the masses  and that, whenever it is concentrated in the hands of a few  governing individuals, it inevitably and immediately turns into reaction.&quot;</i> [<b>No Gods, No Masters</b>, vol. 1, p. 160]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The degeneration of the Russian Revolution can be traced from when  the Bolsheviks seized power <b>on behalf of</b> the Russian working  class and peasantry. The state implies the delegation of power  and initiative into the hands of a few leaders who form the  &quot;revolutionary government.&quot; Yet the power of any revolution, as Bakunin recognised, derives from the decentralisation of power,  from the active participation of the masses in the collective  social movement and the direct action it generates. As soon as  this power passes out of the hands of the working class, the  revolution is doomed: the counter-revolution has begun and it  matters little that it is draped in a red flag. Hence anarchist  opposition to the state.</p>
<p>Sadly, many socialists have failed to recognise this. Hopefully this section of our FAQ will show that the standard explanations of the failure of the Russian revolution are, at their base, superficial  and will only ensure that history will repeat itself.</p>

<h2>1 Do anarchists ignore the objective factors facing the        Russian revolution?</h2>
<p>It is often asserted by Leninists that anarchists simply ignore the &quot;objective factors&quot; facing the Bolsheviks when we discuss the degeneration of the Russian Revolution. Thus, according to this argument, anarchists present a basically idealistic analysis of the failure of Bolshevism, one not rooted in the material  conditions facing (civil war, economic chaos, etc.) facing Lenin and Trotsky.</p>
<p>According to one Trotskyist, anarchists <i>&quot;do not make the slightest attempt at a serious analysis of the situation&quot;</i> and so <i>&quot;other  considerations, of a different, 'theoretical' nature, are to be found in their works.&quot;</i> Thus:</p>
<blockquote><p><i> &quot;Bureaucratic conceptions beget bureaucracy just as opium begets sleep by virtue of its sleep-inducing properties. Trotsky was  wrong to explain the proliferation and rise of the bureaucracy  on the basis of the country's backwardness, low cultural level, and the isolation of the revolution. No, what have rise to a social phenomenon like Stalinism was a conception or idea . . . it is ideas, or deviations from them, that determine the  character of revolutions. The most simplistic kind of  philosophical idealism has laid low historical materialism.&quot;</i>  [Pierre Frank, <i>&quot;Introduction,&quot;</i> Lenin and Trotsky, <b>Kronstadt</b>,  pp. 22-3]  </p></blockquote>
<p>Many other Trotskyists take a similar position (although  most would include the impact of the Civil War on the rise  of Bolshevik authoritarianism and the bureaucracy). Duncan  Hallas, for example, argues that the account of the Bolshevik  counter-revolution given in the Cohn-Bendit brothers' <b>Obsolete Communism</b> is marked by a <i>&quot;complete omission of any consideration of the circumstances in which they [Bolshevik decisions] took  place. The ravages of war and civil war, the ruin of Russian industry, the actual disintegration of the Russian working  class: all of this, apparently, has no bearing on the outcome.&quot;</i> [<b>Towards a Revolutionary Socialist Party</b>, p. 41] Thus the <i>&quot;degree to which workers can 'make their own history' depends on the weight of objective factors bearing down on them . . . To decide in any given circumstance the weight of the subjective and objective factors demands a concrete analysis of the  balance of forces.&quot;</i> The conditions in Russia meant that  the <i>&quot;subjective factor&quot;</i> of Bolshevik ideology <i>&quot;was reduced to a choice between capitulation to the Whites or defending the revolution with whatever means were at hands. Within these limits Bolshevik policy was decisive. But it could not wish away the limits and start with a clean sheet. It is a tribute to the power of the Bolsheviks' politics and organisation that they took the measures necessary and withstood the siege for so long.&quot;</i> [John Rees, <i>&quot;In Defence of October,&quot;</i> pp. 3-82,  <b>International Socialism</b>, no. 52, p. 30]</p>
<p>So, it is argued, by ignoring the problems facing the Bolsheviks  and concentrating on their <b>ideas,</b> anarchists fail to understand  <b>why</b> the Bolsheviks acted as they did. Unsurprisingly anarchists  are not impressed with this argument. This is for a simple reason.  According to anarchist theory the <i>&quot;objective factors&quot;</i> facing  the Bolsheviks are to be expected in <b>any</b> revolution. Indeed,  the likes of Bakunin and Kropotkin predicted that a revolution  would face the very <i>&quot;objective factors&quot;</i> which Leninists use to  justify and rationalise Bolshevik actions (see  <a href="append43.html#app2">next section</a>). As  such, to claim that anarchists ignore the <i>&quot;objective factors&quot;</i>  facing the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution is simply a  joke. How can anarchists be considered to ignore what they  consider to be the inevitable results of a revolution? Moreover,  these Bolshevik assertions ignore the fact that the anarchists  who wrote extensively about their experiences in Russia never  failed to note that difficult objective factors facing it.  Alexander Berkman in <b>The Bolshevik Myth</b> paints a clear picture  of the problems facing the revolution, as does Emma Goldman in  her <b>My Disillusionment in Russia</b>. This is not to mention  anarchists like Voline, Arshinov and Maximoff who took part in the Revolution, experiencing the <i>&quot;objective factors&quot;</i> first hand (and in the case of Voline and Arshinov, participating in the Makhnovist movement which, facing the same factors, managed <b>not</b> to act as the Bolsheviks did).</p>
<p>However, as the claim that anarchists ignore the <i>&quot;objective  circumstances&quot;</i> facing the Bolsheviks is relatively common, it  is important to refute it once and for all. This means that  while have we discussed this issue in association with Leninist  justifications for repressing the Kronstadt revolt (see  <a href="append42.html#app12">section 12</a> of the appendix  <a href="append42.html">&quot;What was the Kronstadt Rebellion?&quot;</a>),  it is worthwhile repeating them here. We are sorry for  the duplication.</p>
<p>Anarchists take it for granted that, to quote Bakunin, revolutions <i>&quot;are not child's play&quot;</i> and that they mean <i>&quot;war, and that implies the destruction of men and things.&quot;</i> The <i>&quot;Social Revolution must  put an end to the old system of organisation based upon violence, giving full liberty to the masses, groups, communes, and associations, and likewise to individuals themselves, and destroying once and for all the historic cause of all violences, the power and existence of the State.&quot;</i> This meant a revolution would be <i>&quot;spontaneous, chaotic, and ruthless, always presupposes a vast destruction of property.&quot;</i> [<b>The Political Philosophy of Bakunin</b>, p. 372, p. 373, p. 380] In other words:</p>
<blockquote><p><i> &quot;The way of the anarchist social revolution, which will come from the people themselves, is an elemental force sweeping away all obstacles. Later, from the depths of the popular soul, there will spontaneously emerge the new creative forms of life.&quot;</i> [<b>Bakunin on Anarchism</b>, p. 325]  </p></blockquote>
<p>He took it for granted that counter-revolution would exist,  arguing that it was necessary to <i>&quot;constitute the federation of insurgent associations, communes and provinces . . . to organise a revolutionary force capable of defeating reaction&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;for the purpose of self-defence.&quot;</i> [<b>Selected Writings</b>, p. 171]</p>
<p>It would, of course, be strange if this necessity for defence and reconstruction would have little impact on the economic conditions in the revolutionised society. The expropriation of the means of production and the land by a free federation of  workers' associations would have an impact on the economy. Kropotkin built upon Bakunin's arguments, stressing that a  <b>social</b> revolution would, by necessity, involve major  difficulties and harsh objective circumstances. It is worth quoting one of his many discussions of this at  length:</p>
<blockquote><p><i> &quot;Suppose we have entered a revolutionary period, with or without civil war -- it does not matter, -- a period when old institutions are falling into ruins and new ones are growing in their place. The movement may be limited to one State, or spread over the world, -- it will have nevertheless the same consequence: an immediate slackening of individual enterprise all over Europe. Capital will conceal itself, and hundreds of capitalists will prefer to abandon their undertakings and go to watering-places  rather than abandon their unfixed capital in industrial production. And we know how a restriction of production in any one branch of industry affects many others, and these in turn spread wider and wider the area of depression. </i></p>
<p><i>&quot;Already, at this moment, millions of those who have created all riches suffer from want of what must be considered  <b>necessaries</b> for the life of a civilised man. . . Let the slightest commotion be felt in the industrial world, and it will take the shape of a general stoppage of work. Let the first attempt at expropriation be made, and the capitalist production of our days will at once come to a stop, and  millions and millions of 'unemployed' will join the ranks  of those who are already unemployed now. </i></p>
<p><i>&quot;More than that . . . The very first advance towards a  Socialist society will imply a thorough reorganisation of  industry as <b>to what we have to produce.</b> Socialism implies  . . . a transformation of industry so that it may be adapted  to the needs of the customer, not those of the profit-maker.  Many a branch of industry must disappear, or limits its  production; many a new one must develop. We are now producing  a great deal for export. But the export trade will be the  first to be reduced as soon as attempts at Social Revolution  are made anywhere in Europe . . .  </i></p>
<p><i>&quot;All that <b>can</b> be, and <b>will</b> be reorganised in time -- not by the State, of course (why, then, not say by Providence?), but by the workers themselves. But, in the meantime, the  worker . . . cannot wait for the gradual reorganisation of industry. . . </i></p>
<p><i>&quot;The great problem of how to supply the wants of millions  will thus start up at once in all its immensity. And the necessity of finding an <b>immediate solution</b> for it is the reason we consider that a step in the direction of  [libertarian] Communism will be imposed on the revolted  society -- not in the future, but as soon as it applies its crowbar to the first stones of the capitalist edifice.&quot;</i> [<b>Act for Yourselves</b>, pp. 57-9]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As noted in  <a href="append42.html#app12">section 12</a> of the appendix on <a href="append42.html">&quot;What was the Kronstadt Uprising?&quot;</a>, the perspective was at the core of Kropotkin's politics. His classic work <b>Conquest of Bread</b> was based on this clear understanding of the nature of a social revolution and the objective problems it will face. As he put it, while a <i>&quot;political revolution can be  accomplished without shaking the foundations of industry&quot;</i> a revolution <i>&quot;where the people lay hands upon property will inevitably paralyse exchange and production . . . This point cannot be too much insisted upon; the reorganisation of industry on a new basis . . . cannot be accomplished in a few days.&quot;</i> Indeed, he considered it essential to <i>&quot;show how tremendous this problem is.&quot;</i> [<b>The Conquest of Bread</b>,  pp. 72-3]</p>
<p>Therefore, <i>&quot;[o]ne of the great difficulties in every Revolution  is the feeding of the large towns.&quot;</i> This was because the <i>&quot;large  towns of modern times are centres of various industries that  are developed chiefly for the sake of the rich or for the export trade&quot;</i> and these <i>&quot;two branches fail whenever any crisis  occurs, and the question then arises of how these great urban agglomerations are to be fed.&quot;</i> This crisis, rather than making revolution impossible, spurred the creation of what Kropotkin terms <i>&quot;the communist movement&quot;</i> in which <i>&quot;the Parisian proletariat had already formed a conception of its class interests and had found men to express them well.&quot;</i> [Kropotkin, <b>The Great French  Revolution</b>, vol. II, p. 457 and p. 504]</p>
<p>As for self-defence, he reproached the authors of classic syndicalist utopia <b>How we shall bring about the Revolution</b> for <i>&quot;considerably attenuat[ing] the resistance that the Social Revolution will probably meet with on its way.&quot;</i> He stressed that the <i>&quot;check of the attempt at Revolution in Russia has shown us all the danger that may follow from an illusion of this kind.&quot;</i> [<i>&quot;preface,&quot;</i> Emile Pataud and Emile Pouget, <b>How we shall bring about the Revolution</b>, p. xxxvi]</p>
<p>It must, therefore, be stressed that the very <i>&quot;objective factors&quot;</i> supporters of Bolshevism use to justify the actions of Lenin and Trotsky were predicted correctly by anarchists decades before  hand. Indeed, rather than ignore them anarchists like Kropotkin  based their political and social ideas on these difficulties. As such, it seems ironic for Leninists to attack anarchists for  allegedly ignoring these factors. It is even more ironic as these very same Leninists are meant to know that <b>any</b> revolution will involve these exact same <i>&quot;objective factors,&quot;</i> something that Lenin and other leading Bolsheviks acknowledged (see  <a href="append43.html#app2">next section</a>).</p>
<p>Therefore, as noted, when anarchists like Emma Goldman and  Alexander Berkman arrived in Russia they were aware of the  problems it, like any revolution, would face. In the words  of Berkman, <i>&quot;what I saw and learned as in such crying contrast  with my hopes and expectations as to shake the very foundation  of my faith in the Bolsheviki. Not that I expected to find  Russia a proletarian Eldorado. By no means. I knew how great  the travail of a revolutionary period, how stupendous the  difficulties to be overcome. Russia was besieged on numerous  fronts; there was counter-revolution within and without; the  blockade was starving the country and denying even medical  aid to sick women and children. The people were exhausted by  long war and civil strive; industry was disorganised, the  railroads broken down. I fully realised the dire situation,  with Russia shedding her blood on the alter of the Revolution.&quot;</i>  [<b>The Bolshevik Myth</b>, p. 329] Emma Goldman expressed similar  opinions. [<b>My Disillusionment in Russia</b>, pp. xlvii-xlix]</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, therefore this extremely realistic  perspective can be found in their later works. Berkman,  for example, stressed that <i>&quot;when the social revolution  had become thoroughly organised and production is  functioning normally there will be enough for  everybody. But in the first stages of the revolution,  during the process of re-construction, we must take  care to supply the people the best we can, and  equally, which means rationing.&quot;</i> This was because the  <i>&quot;first effect of the revolution is reduced production.&quot;</i>  This would be initially due to the general strike which  is its <i>&quot;starting point.&quot;</i> However, <i>&quot;[w]hen the social  revolution begins in any land, its foreign commerce  stops: the importation of raw materials and finished  products is suspended. The country may even be blockaded  by the bourgeois governments.&quot;</i> In addition, he thought  it important not to suppress <i>&quot;small scale industries&quot;</i>  as they would be essential when <i>&quot;a country in revolution  is attacked by foreign governments, when it is blockaded  and deprived of imports, when its large-scale industries  threaten to break down or the railways do break down.&quot;</i>  [<b>ABC of Anarchism</b>, p. 67, p. 74 p. 78-9 and p. 79]</p>
<p>He, of course, considered it essential that to counteract  isolation workers must understand <i>&quot;that their cause is  international&quot;</i> and that <i>&quot;the organisation of labour&quot;</i> must  develop <i>&quot;beyond national boundaries.&quot;</i> However, <i>&quot;the probability is not to be discounted that the revolution may break out in one country sooner than in another&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;in such a case it would become imperative . . . not to wait for possible aid from outside, but immediately to exert all her energies to help herself supply the most essential needs of her people by her own efforts.&quot;</i> [<b>Op.  Cit.</b>, p. 78]</p>
<p>Emma Goldman, likewise, noted that it was <i>&quot;a tragic fact  that all revolutions have sprung from the loins of war.  Instead of translating the revolution into social gains  the people have usually been forced to defend themselves  against warring parties.&quot;</i> <i>&quot;It seems,&quot;</i> she noted, <i>&quot;nothing  great is born without pain and travail&quot;</i> as well as <i>&quot;the  imperative necessity of defending the Revolution.&quot;</i> However, in spite of these inevitable difficulties she point to how the Spanish anarchists <i>&quot;have shown the first example  in history <b>how Revolutions should be made</b>&quot;</i> by <i>&quot;the  constructive work&quot;</i> of <i>&quot;socialising of the land, the  organisation of the industries.&quot;</i> [<b>Vision on Fire</b>, p. 218,  p. 222 and p. 55-56]</p>
<p>These opinions were, as can be seen, to be expected from  revolutionary anarchists schooled in the ideas of Bakunin  and Kropotkin. Clearly, then, far from ignoring the <i>&quot;objective  factors&quot;</i> facing the Bolsheviks, anarchists have based their  politics around them. We have always argued that a social  revolution would face isolation, economic disruption and  civil war and have, for this reason, stressed the importance  of mass participation in order to overcome them. As such,  when Leninists argue that these inevitable <i>&quot;objective factors&quot;</i>  caused the degeneration of Bolshevism, anarchists simply reply  that if it cannot handle the inevitable then Bolshevism should  be avoided. Just as we would avoid a submarine which worked  perfectly well until it was placed in the sea or an umbrella  which only kept you dry when it was not raining.</p>
<p>Moreover, what is to be made of this Leninist argument against  anarchism? In fact, given the logic of their claims we have to argument we have to draw the conclusion that the Leninists seem  to think a revolution <b>could</b> happen <b>without</b> civil war and  economic disruption. As such it suggests that the Leninists  have the <i>&quot;utopian&quot;</i> politics in this matter. After all, if  they argue that civil war is inevitable then how can they  blame the degeneration of the revolution on it? Simply put,  if Bolshevism cannot handle the inevitable it should be avoided at all costs.</p>
<p>Ironically, as indicated in the  <a href="append43.html#app2">next section</a>, we can find ample  arguments to refute the Trotskyist case against the anarchist  analysis in the works of leading Bolsheviks like Lenin, Trotsky  aand Bukharin. Indeed, their arguments provide a striking  confirmation of the anarchist position as they, like Kropotkin,  stress that difficult <i>&quot;objective factors&quot;</i> will face <b>every</b>  revolution. This means to use these factors to justify Bolshevik  authoritarianism simply results in proving that Bolshevism is  simply non-viable or that a liberatory social revolution is,  in fact, impossible (and, as a consequence, genuine socialism).</p>
<p>There are, of course, other reasons why the Leninist critique  of the anarchist position is false. The first is theoretical.  Simply put, the Leninist position is the crudest form of  economic determinism. Ideas <b>do</b> matter and, as Marx himself  stressed, can play a key in how a social process develops.  As we discuss in the appendix on  <a href="append44.html">&quot;How did Bolshevik ideology contribute to the failure of the Revolution?&quot;</a>, Marxist   ideology played a key  role in the degeneration of the revolution and in laying the  groundwork for the rise of Stalinism.</p>
<p>Ultimately, any Leninist defence of Bolshevism based purely on stressing the <i>&quot;objective factor&quot;</i> implies that Bolshevik  ideology played <b>no role</b> in the decisions made by the party  leaders, that they simply operated on autopilot from October  1917 onwards. Yet, at the same time, they stress the importance  of Leninist ideology in ensuring the &quot;victory&quot; of the revolution.  They seek to have it both ways. However, as Samuel Farber puts it:</p>
<blockquote><p><i> &quot;determinism's characteristic and systemic failure is to understand  that what the masses of people do and think politically is as much  part of the process determining the outcome of history as are the  objective obstacles that most definitely limit peoples' choices.&quot;</i>  [<b>Before Stalinism</b>, p. 198]  </p></blockquote>
<p>This is equally applicable when discussing the heads of a highly centralised state who have effectively expropriated political,  economic and social power from the working class and are ruling  in their name. Unsurprisingly, rather than just select policies  at random the Bolshevik leadership pursued consistently before, during and after the civil war policies which reflected their  ideology. Hence there was a preference in policies which  centralised power in the hands of a few (politically <b>and</b>  economically), that saw socialism as being defined by  nationalisation rather than self-management, that stressed  that role and power of the vanguard above that of the working  class, that saw class consciousness as being determined by  how much a worker agreed with the party leadership rather  than whether it expressed the actual needs and interests  of the class as a whole.</p>
<p>Then there is the empirical evidence against the Trotskyist  explanation.</p>
<p>As we indicate in <a href="append43.html#app3">section 3</a>,  soviet democracy and workers'  power in the workplace was <b>not</b> undermined by the civil war.  Rather, the process had began before the civil war started and, equally significantly, continued after its end in November 1920.  Moreover, the <i>&quot;gains&quot;</i> of October Trotskyists claim that Stalinism  destroyed were, in fact, long dead by 1921. Soviet democracy,  working class freedom of speech, association and assembly,  workers' self-management or control in the workplace, trade union  freedom, the ability to strike, and a host of other, elementary,  working class rights had been eliminated long before the end of  the civil war (indeed, often before it started) and, moreover,  the Bolsheviks did not lament this. Rather, <i>&quot;there is no evidence  indicating that Lenin or any mainstream Bolshevik leaders lamented  the loss of workers' control or of democracy in the soviets , or  at least referred to these losses as a retreat, as Lenin declared  with the replacement of War Communism by NEP in 1921.&quot;</i> [Samuel  Farber, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 44]</p>
<p>And then there is the example of the Makhnovist movement. Operating  in the same <i>&quot;objective circumstances,&quot;</i> facing the same <i>&quot;objective  factors,&quot;</i> the Makhnovists did <b>not</b> implement the same policies as  the Bolsheviks. As we discussed in the appendix on <a href="append46.html">&quot;Why does the Makhnovist movement show there is an alternative to Bolshevism?&quot;</a>, rather than undermine  soviet, soldier and workplace democracy and replace all with party  dictatorship, the Makhnovists applied these as fully as they could.  Now, if <i>&quot;objective factors&quot;</i> explain the actions of the Bolsheviks,  then why did the Makhnovists not pursue identical policies?</p>
<p>Simply put, the idea that Bolshevik policies did not impact on  the outcome of the revolution is a false assertion, as the  Makhnovists show. Beliefs are utopian if subjective ideas are  not grounded in objective reality. Anarchists hold that part  of the subjective conditions required before socialism can  exist is the existence of free exchange of ideas and working  class democracy (i.e. self-management). To believe that revolution  is possible without freedom, to believe those in power can, through  their best and genuine intentions, impose socialism from above,  as the Bolsheviks did, is indeed utopian. As the Bolsheviks proved. The Makhnovists shows that the received wisdom is that there was  no alternative open to the Bolsheviks is false.</p>
<p>So while it cannot be denied that objective factors influenced how certain Bolshevik policies were shaped and applied, the inspiration of those policies came from Bolshevik ideology. An acorn will grow  and develop depending on the climate and location it finds itself  in, but regardless of the <i>&quot;objective factors&quot;</i> it will grow into  an oak tree. Similarly with the Russian revolution. While the  circumstances it faced influenced its growth, Bolshevik ideology  could not help but produce an authoritarian regime with no relationship with <b>real</b> socialism.</p>
<p>In summary, anarchists do not ignore the objective factors facing the Bolsheviks during the revolution. As indicated, we  predicted the problems they faced and developed our ideas to  counter them. As the example of the Makhnovists showed, our ideas were more than adequate for the task. Unlike the Bolsheviks.</p>
<p><a name="app2"></a></p>
<h2>2 Can <i>&quot;objective factors&quot;</i> really explain the failure of Bolshevism?</h2>
<p>As noted in the  <a href="append43.html#app1">previous section</a> Leninists tend to argue that anarchists downplay (at best) or ignore (at worse) the <i>&quot;objective factors&quot;</i> facing the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution. As noted in the same section, this argument is simple false. For anarchists have long expected the <i>&quot;objective factors&quot;</i> usually  used to explain the degeneration of the revolution.</p>
<p>However, there is more to it than that. Leninists claim to be revolutionaries. They claim to know that revolutions face problems, the civil war is inevitable and so forth. It therefore strikes anarchists as being somewhat hypocritical for Leninists to blame these very same <i>&quot;objective&quot;</i> but allegedly inevitable factors for the failure of Bolshevism in Russia.</p>
<p>Ironically enough, Lenin and Trotsky agree with these anarchist  arguments. Looking at Trotsky, he dismissed the CNT's leaderships' arguments in favour of collaborating with the bourgeois state:</p>
<blockquote><p><i> &quot;The leaders of the Spanish Federation of Labour (CNT) . . .  became, in the critical hour, bourgeois ministers. They explained  their open betrayal of the theory of anarchism by the pressure of  'exceptional circumstances.' But did not the leaders of the German  social democracy invoke, in their time, the same excuse? Naturally,  civil war is not a peaceful and ordinary but an 'exceptional  circumstance.' Every serious revolutionary organisation, however,  prepares precisely for 'exceptional circumstances' . . . We have  not the slightest intention of blaming the anarchists for not  having liquidated the state with the mere stroke of a pen. A  revolutionary party , even having seized power (of which the  anarchist leaders were incapable in spite of the heroism of the  anarchist workers), is still by no means the sovereign ruler of  society. But all the more severely do we blame the anarchist  theory, which seemed to be wholly suitable for times of peace,  but which had to be dropped rapidly as soon as the 'exceptional  circumstances' of the... revolution had begun. In the old days  there were certain generals - and probably are now - who  considered that the most harmful thing for an army was war.  Little better are those revolutionaries who complain that  revolution destroys their doctrine.&quot;</i> [<b>Stalinism and Bolshevism</b>]  </p></blockquote>
<p>Thus to argue that the <i>&quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;</i> caused by the civil war are the only root cause of the degeneration of the Russian Revolution is a damning indictment of Bolshevism. After all, Lenin did not argue in <b>State and Revolution</b> that the application of soviet democracy was dependent only in <i>&quot;times of peace.&quot;</i> Rather, he stressed that they were for the <i>&quot;exceptional circumstance&quot;</i> of revolution and the civil war he considered its inevitable consequence. As such, we must note that Trotsky's followers do not apply this  critique to their own politics, which are also a form of the  &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot; excuse. Given how quickly Bolshevik  &quot;principles&quot; (as expressed in <b>The State and Revolution</b>) were  dropped, we can only assume that Bolshevik ideas are also suitable  purely for <i>&quot;times of peace&quot;</i> as well. As such, we must note the  irony of Leninist claims that <i>&quot;objective circumstances&quot;</i> explains  the failure of the Bolshevik revolution.</p>
<p>Saying that, we should not that Trotsky was not above using such  arguments himself (making later-day Trotskyists at least ideologically consistent in their hypocrisy). In the same essay, for example, he  justifies the prohibition of other Soviet parties in terms of a  &quot;measure of defence of the dictatorship in a backward and devastated  country, surrounded by enemies on all sides.&quot; In other words, an  appeal to the exceptional circumstances facing the Bolsheviks!  Perhaps unsurprisingly, his followers have tended to stress this (contradictory) aspect of his argument rather than his comments  that those <i>&quot;who propose the abstraction of Soviets to the party dictatorship should understand that only thanks to the party  dictatorship were the Soviets able to lift themselves out of the  mud of reformism and attain the state form of the proletariat. The  Bolshevik party achieved in the civil war the correct combination  of military art and Marxist politics.&quot;</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>] Which, of course,  suggests that the prohibition of other parties had little impact  on levels of soviet &quot;democracy&quot; allowed under the Bolsheviks (see <a href="append41.html#app6">section 6</a> of the appendix on  <a href="append41.html">&quot;What happened during the Russian Revolution?&quot;</a>for more on this).</p>
<p>This dismissal of the <i>&quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;</i> argument  did not originate with Trotsky. Lenin repeatedly stressed  that any revolution would face civil war and economic disruption.  In early January, 1918, he was pointing to <i>&quot;the incredibly  complications of war and economic ruin&quot;</i> in Russia and noting  that <i>&quot;the fact that Soviet power has been established . . . is  why civil war has acquired predominance in Russia at the present  time.&quot;</i> [<b>Collected Works</b>, vol. 26, p. 453 and p. 459]</p>
<p>A few months later he states quite clearly that <i>&quot;it will never be  possible to build socialism at a time when everything is running smoothly and tranquilly; it will never be possible to realise  socialism without the landowners and capitalists putting up a furious resistance.&quot;</i> He reiterated this point, acknowledging  that the <i>&quot;country is poor, the country is poverty-stricken,  and it is impossible just now to satisfy all demands; that is why it is so difficult to build the new edifice in the midst of disruption. But those who believe that socialism can be  built at a time of peace and tranquillity are profoundly mistake: it will be everywhere built at a time of disruption, at a time of famine. That is how it must be.&quot;</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, vol. 27, p. 520 and p. 517]</p>
<p>As regards civil war, he noted that <i>&quot;not one of the great revolutions of history has take place&quot;</i> without one and <i>&quot;without which not a single serious Marxist has conceived the transition from capitalism to socialism.&quot;</i> Moreover, <i>&quot;there can be no civil war -- the inevitable condition and concomitant of socialist revolution -- without  disruption.&quot;</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 496 and p. 497] He considered this  disruption as being applicable to advanced capitalist nations as  well:</p>
<blockquote><p><i> &quot;In Germany, state capitalism prevails, and therefore the  revolution in Germany will be a hundred times more devastating  and ruinous than in a petty-bourgeois country -- there, too,  there will be gigantic difficulties and tremendous chaos and  imbalance.&quot;</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, vol. 28, p. 298]  </p></blockquote>
<p>And from June, 1918:</p>
<blockquote><p><i> &quot;We must be perfectly clear in our minds about the new disasters that civil war brings for every country. The more cultured a  country is the more serious will be these disasters. Let us  picture to ourselves a country possessing machinery and  railways in which civil war is raging., and this civil war cuts off communication between the various parts of the country.  Picture to yourselves the condition of regions which for decades have been accustomed to living by the interchange of manufactured goods and you will understand that every civil war brings forth disasters.&quot;</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, vol. 27, p. 463]  </p></blockquote>
<p>As we discuss in <a href="append43.html#app4">section 4</a>,  the economic state of Germany immediately after the end of the war suggests that Lenin had a  point. Simply put, the German economy was in a serious state of devastation, a state equal to that of Russia during the equivalent period of its revolution. If economic conditions made party  dictatorship inevitable in Bolshevik Russia (as pro-Leninists argue) it would mean that soviet democracy and revolution cannot go together.</p>
<p>Lenin reiterated this point again and again. He argued that <i>&quot;we  see famine not only in Russia, but in the most cultured, advanced countries, like Germany . . . it is spread over a longer period than in Russia, but it is famine nevertheless, still more severe and painful than here.&quot;</i> In fact, <i>&quot;today even the richest countries  are experiencing unprecedented food shortages and that the  overwhelming majority of the working masses are suffering  incredible torture.&quot;</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, vol. 27, p. 460 and p. 461]</p>
<p>Lenin, unlike many of his latter day followers, did not consider these grim objective conditions are making revolution impossible. Rather, for him, there was <i>&quot;no other way out of this war&quot;</i> which is causing the problems <i>&quot;except revolution, except civil war . . . a war which always accompanies not only great revolutions but every serious revolution in history.&quot;</i> He continued by arguing  that we <i>&quot;must be perfectly clear in our minds about the new  disasters that civil war brings for every country. The more  cultured a country is the more serious will be these disasters.  Let us picture to ourselves a country possessing machinery and  railways in which civil war is raging, and this civil war cuts  communication between the various parts of the country. Picture  to yourselves the condition of regions which for decades have  been accustomed to living by interchange of manufactured goods  and you will understand that every civil war brings fresh  disasters.&quot;</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 463] The similarities to Kropotkin's arguments made three decades previously are clear (see  <a href="append43.html#app1">section 1</a> for details).</p>
<p>Indeed, he mocked those who would argue that revolution could occur with <i>&quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p><i> &quot;A revolutionary would not 'agree' to a proletarian revolution only 'on the condition' that it proceeds easily and smoothly, that there is, from the outset, combined action on the part of proletarians of different countries, that there are  guarantees against defeats, that the road of the revolution is broad, free and straight, that it will not be necessary during the march to victory to sustain the heaviest casualties, to 'bide one's time in a besieged fortress,' or to make one's way along extremely narrow, impassable, winding and dangerous mountain tracks. Such a person is no revolutionary.&quot;</i>  [<b>Selected Works</b>, vol. 2, p. 709]  </p></blockquote>
<p>He then turned his fire on those who failed to recognise the problems facing a revolution and instead simply blamed the Bolsheviks:</p>
<blockquote><p><i> &quot;The revolution engendered by the war cannot avoid the terrible difficulties and suffering bequeathed it by the prolonged,  ruinous, reactionary slaughter of the nations. To blame us for the 'destruction' of industry, or for the 'terror', is either hypocrisy or dull-witted pedantry; it reveals an inability to understand the basic conditions of the fierce class struggle, raised to the highest degree of intensity, that is called revolution.&quot;</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, pp. 709-10]  </p></blockquote>
<p>Thus industrial collapse and terrible difficulties would face any revolution. It goes without saying that if it was <i>&quot;hypocrisy&quot;</i> to blame Bolshevik politics for these problems, it would be the same to blame these problems for Bolshevik politics. As Lenin noted, <i>&quot;in revolutionary epochs the class struggle has always, inevitably, and in every country, assumed the form of <b>civil war,</b> and civil war is inconceivable without the severest destruction, terror and the restriction of formal democracy in the interests of this war.&quot;</i> Moreover, <i>&quot;[w]e know  that fierce resistance to the socialist revolution on the part  of the bourgeoisie is inevitable in all countries, and that this resistance will <b>grow</b> with the growth of the  revolution.&quot;</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 710 and p. 712] To blame the  inevitable problems of a revolution for the failings of  Bolshevism suggests that Bolshevism is simply not suitable  for revolutionary situations.</p>
<p>At the 1920 Comintern Congress Lenin lambasted a German socialist who argued against revolution because <i>&quot;Germany was so weakened by the War&quot;</i> that if it had been <i>&quot;blockaded again the misery of the  German masses would have been even more dreadful.&quot;</i> Dismissing this argument, Lenin argued as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p><i> &quot;A revolution . . . can be made only if it does not worsen the workers' conditions 'too much.' Is it permissible, in a communist party, to speak in a tone like this, I ask? This is the language of counter-revolution. The standard of living in Russia is  undoubtedly lower than in Germany, and when we established the dictatorship, this led to the workers beginning to go more hungry and to their conditions becoming even worse. The workers' victory cannot be achieved without sacrificing, without a  temporary deterioration of their conditions. . . If the German  workers now want to work for the revolution, they must make sacrifices and not be afraid to do so . . . The labour aristocracy, which is afraid of sacrifices, afraid of 'too great' impoverishment during the revolutionary struggle, cannot belong to the party. Otherwise the dictatorship is impossible, especially in western European countries.&quot;</i> [<b>Proceedings and Documents of the Second  Congress 1920</b>, pp. 382-3]  </p></blockquote>
<p>In 1921 he repeated this, arguing that <i>&quot;every revolution entails enormous sacrifice on the part of the class making it. . .  The dictatorship of the proletariat in Russia has entailed for the ruling class -- the proletariat -- sacrifices, want and privation unprecedented in history, and the case will, in all probability, be the same in every other country.&quot;</i> [<b>Collected Works</b>, vol. 32,  p. 488] Thus Lenin is on record as saying these &quot;objective factors&quot;  will always be the circumstances facing a socialist revolution.  Indeed, in November 1922 he stated that <i>&quot;Soviet rule in Russia is  celebrating its fifth anniversary, It is now sounder than ever.&quot;</i>  [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, vol. 33, p. 417]</p>
<p>All of which must be deeply embarrassing to Leninists. After all, here is Lenin arguing that the factors Leninist's list as being responsible for the degeneration of the Russian Revolution were inevitable side effects of <b>any</b> revolution!</p>
<p>Nor was this perspective limited to Lenin. The inevitability of  economic collapse being associated with a revolution was not  lost on Trotsky either (see  <a href="append42.html#app12">section 12</a> of the appendix on <a href="append42.html">&quot;What was the Kronstadt Rebellion?&quot;</a>). Nikolai Bukharin even wrote the (infamous) <b>The Economics of the Transition  Period</b> to make theoretical sense of (i.e. rationalise and  justify) the party's changing policies and their social  consequences since 1918 in terms of the inevitability of  bad &quot;objective factors&quot; facing the revolution. While some  Leninists like to paint Bukharin's book (like most Bolshevik  ideas of the time) as <i>&quot;making a virtue out of necessity,&quot;</i>  Bukharin (like the rest of the Bolshevik leadership) did not.  As one commentator notes, Bukharin <i>&quot;belive[d] that he was  formulating universal laws of proletarian revolution.&quot;</i> [Stephan  F. Cohen, <b>In Praise of War Communism: Bukharin's The  Economics of the Transition Period</b>, p. 195]</p>
<p>Bukharin listed four <i>&quot;real costs of revolution,&quot;</i> namely <i>&quot;the  physical destruction or deterioration of material and living elements of production, the atomisation of these elements and of sectors of the economy, and the need for unproductive consumption (civil war materials, etc.). These costs were interrelated and followed sequentially. Collectively they resulted in '<b>the curtailment of the process of reproduction</b>' (and 'negative expanded reproduction') and Bukharin's main conclusion: 'the production <i>&quot;anarchy&quot;</i> . . . , <i>&quot;the revolutionary disintegration of industry,&quot;</i> is an historically inevitable stage which no amount of lamentation will prevent.'&quot;</i> This was part of a general argument and his <i>&quot;point was that great  revolutions were always accompanied by destructive civil wars . . .  But he was more intent on proving that a proletarian revolution  resulted in an even greater temporary fall in production than did  its bourgeois counterpart.&quot;</i> To do this he formulated the <i>&quot;costs of revolution&quot;</i> as <i>&quot;a law of revolution.&quot;</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, pp. 195-6 and  p. 195]</p>
<p>Cohen notes that while this <i>&quot;may appear to have been an obvious point, but it apparently came as something of a revelation to many Bolsheviks. It directly opposed the prevailing Social  Democratic assumption that the transition to socialism would be relatively painless . . . Profound or not, Bolsheviks  generally came to accept the 'law' and to regard it as a  significant discovery by Bukharin.&quot;</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 196] To  quote Bukharin:</p>
<blockquote><p><i> &quot;during the transition period the labour apparatus of society  inevitably disintegrates, that reorganisation presupposes  disorganisation, and that there the temporary collapse of  productive forces is a law inherent to revolution.&quot;</i> [quoted by Cohen, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 196]  </p></blockquote>
<p>It would appear that this <i>&quot;obvious point&quot;</i> would <b>still</b> come  <i>&quot;as something of a revelation to many Bolsheviks&quot;</i> today!  Significantly, of course, Kropotkin had formulated this  law decades previously! How the Bolsheviks sought to cope  with this inevitable law is what signifies the difference  between anarchism and Leninism. Simply put, Bukharin endorsed  the coercive measures of war communism as the means to go  forward to socialism. As Cohen summarises, <i>&quot;force and coercion  . . . were the means by which equilibrium was to be forged out  of disequilibrium.&quot;</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 198] Given that Bukharin  argued that a workers' state, by definition, could not exploit  the workers, he opened up the possibility for rationalising  all sorts of abuses as well as condoning numerous evils  because they were <i>&quot;progressive.&quot;</i> Nor was Bukharin alone  in this, as Lenin and Trotsky came out with similar nonsense.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Lenin showed <i>&quot;ecstatic praise for the  most 'war communist' sections&quot;</i> of Bukharin's work. <i>&quot;Almost  every passage,&quot;</i> Cohen notes, <i>&quot;on the role of the new state, statisation in general, militarisation and mobilisation met with 'very good,' often in three languages,  . . . Most  striking, Lenin's greatest enthusiasm was reserved for the chapter on the role of coercion . . . at the end [of which] he wrote, 'Now this chapter is superb!'&quot;</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, pp. 202-3] Compare this to Kropotkin's comment that the <i>&quot;revolutionary tribunal and the guillotine could not make up for the lack of a constructive communist theory.&quot;</i> [<b>The Great French Revolution</b>, vol. II, p. 519]</p>
<p>Ultimately, claims that &quot;objective factors&quot; caused the  degeneration of the revolution are mostly attempts to  let the Bolsheviks of the hook for Stalinism. This approach was started by Trotsky and continued to this day. Anarchists,  unsurprisingly, do not think much of these explanations. For  anarchists, the list of &quot;objective factors&quot; listed to explain the degeneration of the revolution are simply a list of factors  <b>every</b> revolution would (and has) faced -- as Lenin, Bukharin  and Trotsky all admitted at the time!</p>
<p>So we have the strange paradox of Leninists dismissing and ignoring the arguments of their ideological gurus. For Trotsky, just as for Lenin, it was a truism that revolutionary politics  had to handle <i>&quot;objective&quot;</i> factors and <i>&quot;exceptional circumstances.&quot;</i>  And for both, they thought they had during the Russian revolution.  Yet for their followers, these explain the failure of Bolshevism.  Tony Cliff, one of Trotsky's less orthodox followers, gives us  a means of understanding this strange paradox. Discussing the  <b>Platform of the United Opposition</b> he notes that it <i>&quot;also  suffered from the inheritance of the exceptional conditions  of the civil war, when the one-party system was transformed  from a necessity into a virtue.&quot;</i> [<b>Trotsky</b>, vol. 3, pp. 248-9]  Clearly, <i>&quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;</i> explain nothing and are  simply an excuse for bad politics while <i>&quot;exceptional conditions&quot;</i>  explain everything and defeat even the best politics!</p>
<p>As such, it seems to us extremely ironic that Leninists blame  the civil war for the failure of the revolution as they  continually raise the inevitability of civil war in a  revolution to attack anarchism (see  <a href="secH2.html#sech21">section H.2.1</a> for an  example). Did Lenin not explain in <b>State and Revolution</b> that his <i>&quot;workers' state&quot;</i> was designed to defend the revolution and suppress capitalist resistance? If it cannot do its  proclaimed task then, clearly, it is a flawed theory.  Ultimately, if <i>&quot;civil war&quot;</i> and the other factors listed by  Leninists (but considered inevitable by Lenin) preclude the  implementation of the radical democracy Lenin argued for  in 1917 as the means to suppress the resistance of the  capitalists then his followers should come clean and say  that that work has no bearing on their vision of revolution. Therefore, given that the usual argument for the <i>&quot;dictatorship  of the proletariat&quot;</i> is that it is required to repress  counter-revolution, it seems somewhat ironic that the event  it was said to be designed for (i.e. revolution) should be  responsible for its degeneration!</p>
<p>As such, anarchists tend to think these sorts of explanations of Bolshevik dictatorship are incredulous. After all, as  <b>revolutionaries</b> the people who expound these <i>&quot;explanations&quot;</i>  are meant to know that civil war, imperialist invasion and  blockade, economic disruption, and a host of other <i>&quot;extremely  difficult circumstances&quot;</i> are part and parcel of a revolution.  They seem to be saying, &quot;if only the ruling class had not  acted as our political ideology predicts they would then the  Bolshevik revolution would have been fine&quot;! As Bertrand Russell  argued after his trip to Soviet Russia, while since October  1917 <i>&quot;the Soviet Government has been at war with almost all  the world, and has at the same time to face civil war at  home&quot;</i> this was <i>&quot;not to be regarded as accidental, or as a  misfortune which could not be foreseen. According to Marxian  theory, what has happened was bound to happen.&quot;</i> [<b>The Theory  and Practice of Bolshevism</b>, p. 103]</p>
<p>In summary, anarchists are not at all convinced by the claims that <i>&quot;objective factors&quot;</i> can explain the failure of the Russian Revolution. After all, according to Lenin and Trotsky these  factors were to be expected in <b>any</b> revolution -- civil war  and invasion, economic collapse and so forth were not restricted to the Russian revolution. That is why they say they want a  &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat,&quot; to defend against  counter-revolution (see  <a href="secH3.html#sech38">section H.3.8</a> on how, once in power, Lenin and Trotsky revised this position). Now, if Bolshevism  cannot handle what it says is inevitable, then it should be  avoided. To use an analogy:</p>
<blockquote><p> <b>Bolshevik: <i>&quot;Join with us, we have a great umbrella which will              keep us dry.&quot;</i> </b></p>
<p><b>Anarchist: <i>&quot;Last time it was used, it did not work. We all got              soaked!&quot;</i> </b></p>
<p><b>Bolshevik: <i>&quot;But what our anarchist friend fails to mention is              that it was raining at the time!&quot;</i> </b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not very convincing! Yet, sadly, this is the logic of the common Leninist justification of Bolshevik authoritarianism during the Russian Revolution.</p>
<p><a name="app3"></a></p>
<h2>3 Can the civil war explain the failure of Bolshevism?</h2>
<p>One of the most common assertions against the anarchists case against Bolshevism is that while we condemn the Bolsheviks,  we fail to mention the civil war and the wars of intervention. Indeed, for most Leninists the civil war is usually considered the key event in the development of Bolshevism, explaining and justifying all anti-socialist acts conducted by them after they seized power.</p>
<p>For anarchists, such an argument is flawed on two levels, namely logical and factual. The logical flaw is that Leninist argue  that civil war is inevitable after a revolution. They maintain, correctly, that it is unlikely that the ruling class will  disappear without a fight. Then they turn round and complain that because the ruling class did what the Marxists predicted, the Russian Revolution failed! And they (incorrectly) harp on about  anarchists ignoring civil war (see  <a href="secH2.html#sech21">section H.2.1</a>).</p>
<p>So, obviously, this line of defence is nonsense. If civil war is  inevitable, then it cannot be used to justify the failure of the Bolshevism. Marxists simply want to have their cake and eat it to.  You simply cannot argue that civil war is inevitable and then blame it for the failure of the Russian Revolution.</p>
<p>The other flaw in this defence of Bolshevism is the factual one, namely the awkward fact that Bolshevik authoritarianism started <b>before</b> the civil war broke out. Simply put, it is difficult to  blame a course of actions on an event which had not started yet. Moreover, Bolshevik authoritarianism <b>increased</b> after the civil  war finished. This, incidentally, caused anarchists like Alexander Berkman to re-evaluate their support for Bolshevism. As he put it,  <i>&quot;I would not concede the appalling truth. Still the hope persisted that the Bolsheviki, though absolutely wrong in principle and practice, yet grimly held on to <b>some</b> shreds of the revolutionary banner. 'Allied interference,' 'the blockade and civil war,' 'the necessity of the transitory stage' -- thus I sought to placate my outraged conscience . .  . At last the fronts were liquidated, civil war ended, and the country at peace. But Communist policies did not change. On the contrary . . . The party groaned under the unbearable yoke of the Party dictatorship. . . . Then came  Kronstadt and its simultaneous echoes throughout the land . . .  Kronstadt was crushed as ruthlessly as Thiers and Gallifet  slaughtered the Paris Communards. And with Kronstadt the entire country and its last hope. With it also my faith in the  Bolsheviki.&quot;</i> [<b>The Bolshevik Myth</b>, p. 331]</p>
<p>If Berkman had been in Russia in 1918, he may have realised that the Bolshevik tyranny during the civil war (which climaxed, post civil war, with the attack on Kronstadt -- see the appendix on  <a href="append42.html">&quot;What was the Kronstadt Rebellion?&quot;</a> for more on the Kronstadt rebellion) was not at odds with their  pre-civil war activities to maintain their power. The simple  fact is that Bolshevik authoritarianism was <b>not</b> caused by the  pressures of the civil war, rather they started before then. All  the civil war did was strengthen certain aspects of Bolshevik ideology and practice which had existed from the start (see  the appendix on <a href="append44.html">&quot;How did Bolshevik ideology contribute to the failure of the   Revolution?&quot;</a>).</p>
<p>While we discuss the Russian Revolution in more detail in  the appendix on <a href="append41.html">&quot;What happened during the Russian Revolution?&quot;</a>, it is  useful to summarise the Bolshevik attacks on working class power and autonomy before the civil war broke out (i.e. before the end of May 1918).</p>
<p>The most important development during this period was the  suppression of soviet democracy and basic freedoms. As we discuss in <a href="append41.html#app6">section 6</a> of the appendix on <a href="append41.html">&quot;What happened during the Russian Revolution?&quot;</a>,  the Bolsheviks pursued a policy of systematically undermining soviet democracy  from the moment they seized power. The first act was the creation of a Bolshevik government over the soviets, so marginalising the very organs they claimed ruled in Russia. The process was repeated in the local soviets, with the executive committees holding real power while the plenary sessions become infrequent and of little consequence.  Come the spring of 1918, faced with growing working class opposition they started to delay soviet elections. When finally forced to hold elections, the Bolsheviks responded in two ways to maintain their power. Either they gerrymandered the soviets, packing them with representatives of Bolshevik dominated organisation or they simply disbanded them by  force if they lost the soviet elections (and repressed by  force any protests against this). This was the situation at the grassroots. At the summit of the soviet system,  the Bolsheviks simply marginalised the Central Executive Committee of the soviets. Real power was held by the  Bolshevik government. The power of the soviets had simply become a fig-leaf for a &quot;soviet power&quot; -- the handful of Bolsheviks who made up the government and the party's central committee.</p>
<p>It should be stressed that the Bolshevik assault on the soviets occurred in March, April and May 1918. That is, <b>before</b> the Czech uprising and the onset of full-scale civil war. So, to  generalise, it cannot be said that it was the Bolshevik party  that alone whole-heartedly supported Soviet power. The facts  are that the Bolsheviks only supported <i>&quot;Soviet power&quot;</i> when the  soviets were Bolshevik. As recognised by the left-Menshevik  Martov, who argued that the Bolsheviks loved Soviets only when  they were <i>&quot;in the hands of the Bolshevik party.&quot;</i> [quoted by  Getzler, <b>Martov</b>, p. 174] If the workers voted for others,  <i>&quot;soviet power&quot;</i> was quickly replaced by party power (the real  aim). The Bolsheviks had consolidated their position in early  1918, turning the Soviet State into a de facto one party state  by gerrymandering and disbanding of soviets before the start of  the Civil War.</p>
<p>Given this legacy of repression, Leninist Tony Cliff's assertion  that it was only <i>&quot;under the iron pressure of the civil war [that]  the Bolshevik leaders were forced to move, as the price of survival,  to <b>a one-party system</b>&quot;</i> needs serious revising. Similarly, his comment that the <i>&quot;civil war undermined the operation of the  local soviets&quot;</i> is equally inaccurate, as his is claim that <i>&quot;for some time -- i.e. until the armed uprising of the Czechoslovak Legion -- the Mensheviks were not much hampered in their  propaganda work.&quot;</i> Simply put, Cliff's statement that <i>&quot;it was about a year after the October Revolution before an actual monopoly of political power was held by one party&quot;</i> is false. Such a monopoly existed <b>before</b> the start of the civil war, with extensive political repression existing <b>before</b> the  uprising of the Czechoslovak Legion which began it. There  was a <b>de facto</b> one-party state by the spring of 1918.  [<b>Lenin</b>, vol. 3, p. 163, p. 150, p. 167 and p. 172]</p>
<p>The suppression of Soviet democracy reached it logical conclusion  in 1921 when the Kronsdadt soviet, heart of the 1917 revolution, was  stormed by Bolshevik forces, its leaders executed or forced into  exile and the rank and file imprisoned, and scattered all over the  USSR. Soviet democracy was not just an issue of debate but one many  workers died in fighting for. As can be seen, similar events to  those at Kronstadt had occurred three years previously.</p>
<p>Before turning to other Bolshevik attacks on working class power and freedom, we need to address one issue. It will be proclaimed that the Mensheviks (and SRs) were <i>&quot;counter-revolutionaries&quot;</i> and so Bolshevik actions against them were justified. However, the Bolsheviks' started to suppress opposition soviets <b>before</b> the  civil war broke out, so at the time neither group could be called <i>&quot;counter-revolutionary&quot;</i> in any meaningful sense of the word. The Civil War started on the 25th of May and the SRs and Mensheviks  were expelled from the Soviets on the 14th of June. While the  Bolsheviks <i>&quot;offered some formidable fictions to justify the  expulsions&quot;</i> there was <i>&quot;of course no substance in the charge  that the Mensheviks had been mixed in counter-revolutionary  activities on the Don, in the Urals, in Siberia, with the  Czechoslovaks, or that they had joined the worst Black Hundreds.&quot;</i>  [Getzler, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 181] The charge that the Mensheviks <i>&quot;were active supporters of intervention and of counter-revolution&quot;</i> was <i>&quot;untrue . . . and the Communists, if they ever believed it, never succeeded in establishing it.&quot;</i> [Schapiro, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 193] The Bolsheviks expelled the Mensheviks in the context of political  loses before the Civil War. As Getzler notes the Bolsheviks <i>&quot;drove  them underground, just on the eve of the elections to the Fifth  Congress of Soviets in which the Mensheviks were expected to make  significant gains.&quot;</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 181]</p>
<p>Attacks on working class freedoms and democracy were not limited to the soviets. As well as the gerrymandering and disbanding of  soviets, the Bolsheviks had already presented economic visions  much at odds with what most people consider as fundamentally  socialist. Lenin, in April 1918, was arguing for one-man management and <i>&quot;[o]bedience, and unquestioning obedience at  that, during work to the one-man decisions of Soviet directors,  of the dictators elected or appointed by Soviet institutions,  vested with dictatorial powers.&quot;</i> [<b>Six Theses on the Immediate  Tasks of the Soviet Government</b>, p. 44] His support for a new form of wage slavery involved granting state appointed <i>&quot;individual  executives dictatorial powers (or 'unlimited' powers).&quot;</i> Large-scale  industry (<i>&quot;the foundation of socialism&quot;</i>) required <i>&quot;thousands  subordinating their will to the will of one,&quot;</i> and so the revolution  &quot;demands&quot; that <i>&quot;the people <b>unquestioningly</b> obey the single will  of the leaders of labour.&quot;</i> Lenin's <i>&quot;superior forms of labour  discipline&quot;</i> were simply hyper-developed capitalist forms. The  role of workers in production was the same, but with a novel  twist, namely <i>&quot;unquestioning obedience to the orders of individual  representatives of the Soviet government during the work.&quot;</i> [Lenin,  <b>Selected Writings</b>, vol. 2, p. 610, p. 611, p. 612]</p>
<p>This simply replaced private capitalism with <b>state</b>  capitalism. <i>&quot;In the shops where one-man management  (Lenin's own preference) replaced collegial management,&quot;</i>  notes Diane Koenker, <i>&quot;workers faced the same kinds of  authoritarian management they thought existed only under  capitalism.&quot;</i> [<b>Labour Relations in Socialist Russia</b>,  p. 177] If, as many Leninists claim, one-man management  was a key factor in the rise of Stalinism and/or  <i>&quot;state-capitalism&quot;</i> in Russia, then, clearly, Lenin's  input in these developments cannot be ignored. After  advocating <i>&quot;one-man management&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;state capitalism&quot;</i>  in early 1918, he remained a firm supporter of them.  In the light of this it is bizarre that some later day  Leninists claim that the Bolsheviks only introduced one-man  management because of the Civil War. Clearly, this was <b>not</b>  the case. It was <b>this</b> period (before the civil war) that saw Lenin advocate and start to take the control of the economy  out of the hands of the workers and placed into the hands of  the Bolshevik party and the state bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the Bolshevik undermining of the factory  committee movement and, consequently, genuine worker's  self-management of production in favour of state capitalism  cannot be gone into great depth here (see the appendix on <a href="append41.html">&quot;What happened during the Russian   Revolution?&quot;</a>,  for a  fuller discussion). Suffice to say, the factory committees  were deliberately submerged in the trade unions and state  control replaced workers' control. This involved practising  one-man management and, as Lenin put in at the start of May  1918, <i>&quot;our task is to study the state capitalism of the  Germans, to spare <b>no effort</b> in copying it and not to shrink  from adopting <b>dictatorial</b> methods to hasten the copying of  it.&quot;</i> He stressed that this was no new idea, rather he <i>&quot;gave it <b>before</b> the Bolsheviks seized power.&quot;</i> [<b>Selected Writings</b>,  vol. 2, p. 635 and p. 636]</p>
<p>It will be objected that Lenin advocated <i>&quot;workers' control.&quot;</i>  This is true, but a <i>&quot;workers' control&quot;</i> of a <b>very</b> limited  nature. As we discuss in  <a href="secH3.html#sech314">section H.3.14</a>, rather than seeing  &quot;workers' control&quot; as workers managing production directly,  he always saw it in terms of workers' <i>&quot;controlling&quot;</i> those who  did and his views on this matter were <b>radically</b> different to those of the factory committees. This is not all, as  Lenin always placed his ideas in a statist context -- rather  than base socialist reconstruction on working class  self-organisation from below, the Bolsheviks started <i>&quot;to  build, from the top, its 'unified administration'&quot;</i> based on  central bodies created by the Tsarist government in 1915 and  1916. [Maurice Brinton, <b>The Bolsheviks and Workers' Control</b>,  p. 36] The institutional framework of capitalism would  be utilised as the principal (almost exclusive) instruments  of &quot;socialist&quot; transformation. Lenin's support for <i>&quot;one-man  management&quot;</i> must be seen in this context, namely his  vision of &quot;socialism.&quot;</p>
<p>Bolshevik advocating and implementing of <i>&quot;one-man management&quot;</i> was  not limited to the workplace. On March 30th Trotsky, as Commissar  of Military Affairs, set about  reorganising the army. The death  penalty for disobedience under fire was reintroduced, as was  saluting officers, special forms of address, separate living  quarters and privileges for officers. Officers were no longer  elected. Trotsky made it clear: <i>&quot;The elective basis is politically  pointless and technically inexpedient and has already been set  aside by decree.&quot;</i> [quoted by Brinton, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, pp. 37-8] The soldiers were given no say in their fate, as per bourgeois armies.</p>
<p>Lenin's proposals also struck at the heart of workers' power  in other ways. For example, he argued that <i>&quot;we must raise the  question of piece-work and apply it . . . in practice.&quot;</i> [<b>The  Immediate Tasks Of The Soviet Government</b>, p. 23] As Leninist  Tony Cliff (of all people) noted, <i>&quot;the employers have at  their disposal a number of effective methods of disrupting th[e]  unity [of workers as a class]. Once of the most important of these  is the fostering of competition between workers by means of  piece-work systems.&quot;</i> He notes that these were used by the Nazis  and the Stalinists <i>&quot;for the same purpose.&quot;</i> [<b>State Capitalism in  Russia</b>, pp. 18-9] Obviously piece-work is different when Lenin  introduces it!</p>
<p>Finally, there is the question of general political freedom. It goes without saying that the Bolsheviks suppressed freedom of the press (for left-wing opposition groups as well as capitalist ones). It was also in this time period that the Bolsheviks first  used the secret police to attack opposition groups. Unsurprisingly,  this was not directed against the right. The anarchists in Moscow  were attacked on the night of April 11-12, with armed detachments of the Cheka raiding 26 anarchist centres, killing or wounding 40  and jailing 500. Shortly afterwards the Cheka carried out similar  raids in Petrograd and in the provinces. In May <b>Burevestnik</b>,  <b>Anarkhiia</b>, <b>Golos Truda</b> and other leading anarchist periodicals  closed down. [Paul Avrich, <b>The Russian Anarchists</b>, pp. 184-5] It must surely be a coincidence that there had been a <i>&quot;continued growth of anarchist influence among unskilled workers&quot;</i> after the October revolution and, equally coincidentally, that <i>&quot;[b]y  the spring of 1918, very little was heard from the anarchists in  Petrograd.&quot;</i> [David Mandel, <b>The Petrograd Workers and the Soviet  Seizure of Power</b>, p. 357]</p>
<p>All this <b>before</b> the Trotsky provoked revolt of the Czech legion at the end of May, 1918, and the consequent &quot;democratic  counter-revolution&quot; in favour of the Constituent Assembly (which the right-Socialist Revolutionaries led). This, to repeat, was  months before the rise of the White Armies and Allied intervention.  In summary, it was <b>before</b> large-scale civil war took place,  in an interval of relative peace, that we see the introduction of  most of the measures Leninists now try and pretend were  necessitated by the Civil War itself.</p>
<p>So if anarchists appear to &quot;downplay&quot; the effects of the civil war it is not because we ignore. We simply recognise that if you think it is inevitable, you cannot blame it for the actions of the  Bolsheviks. Moreover, when the Bolsheviks eliminated military democracy, undermined the factory committees, started to disband  soviets elected with the &quot;wrong&quot; majority, repress the anarchists  and other left-wing opposition groups, and so on, <b>the civil war  had not started yet.</b> So the rot had started before civil war  (and consequent White Terror) and &quot;imperialist intervention&quot;  started. Given that Lenin said that civil war was inevitable,  blaming the inevitable (which had not even started yet!) for  the failure of Bolshevism is <b>not</b> very convincing.</p>
<p>This factual problem with the <i>&quot;civil war caused Bolshevik  authoritarianism&quot;</i> is the best answer to it. If the Bolsheviks  pursued authoritarian policies before the civil war started,  it is hard to justify their actions in terms of something that  had not started yet. This explains why some Leninists have  tried to muddy the waters somewhat by obscuring when the  civil war started. For example, John Rees states that <i>&quot;[m]ost historians treat the revolution and the civil war as separate processes&quot;</i> yet <i>&quot;[i]n reality they were one.&quot;</i> He presents a catalogue of <i>&quot;armed resistance to the revolution,&quot;</i> including such <i>&quot;precursors of civil war before the revolution&quot;</i> as the suppression after the July days and the Kornilov revolt in 1917. [John Rees, <i>&quot;In Defence of October,&quot;</i> pp. 3-82, <b>International  Socialism</b>, no. 52, p. 31-2]</p>
<p>Ironically, Rees fails to see how this blurring of when the civil war started actually <b>harms</b> Leninism. After all, most historians place the start of the civil war when the Czech legion revolted <b>because</b> it marked large-scale conflict  between armies. It is one thing to say that authoritarianism was caused by large-scale conflict, another to say <b>any</b> form of conflict caused it. Simply put, if the Bolshevik state could not handle relatively minor forms of counter-revolution then where does that leave Lenin's <b>State and Revolution</b>? So while  the period from October to May of 1918 was not trouble free,  it was not one where the survival of the new regime looked  to be seriously threatened as it was after that, particularly  in 1919 and 1920. Thus &quot;civil war&quot; will be used, as it is commonly done, to refer to the period from the Czech revolt (late May 1918) to the final defeat of Wrangel (November 1920).</p>
<p>So, the period from October to May of 1918, while not trouble  free, was not one where the survival of the new regime looked  to be seriously threatened as it was to be in 1919 and 1920.  This means attempts to push the start of the civil war back to October 1917 (or even earlier) simply weakens the Leninist argument. It still leaves the major problem for the <i>&quot;blame it  on the civil war&quot;</i> Leninists, namely to explain why the months  <b>before</b> May of 1918 saw soviets being closed down, the start  of the suppression of the factory committees, restrictions on  freedom of speech and association, plus the repression of  opposition groups (like the anarchists). Either any level of &quot;civil war&quot; makes Lenin's <b>State and Revolution</b> redundant or the source of Bolshevik authoritarianism must be found elsewhere.</p>
<p>That covers the period <b>before</b> the start of the civil war.  we now turn to the period <b>after</b> it finished. Here we find the same problem, namely an <b>increase</b> of authoritarianism even after the proclaimed cause for it (civil war) had ended.</p>
<p>After the White General Wrangel was forced back into the Crimea, he had to evacuate his forced to Constantinople in November 1920.  With this defeat the Russian civil war had come to an end. Those  familiar with the history of the revolution will realise that  it was some 4 months <b>later</b> that yet another massive strike wave occurred, the Kronstadt revolt took place and the 10th Party  Congress banned the existence of factions within the Bolshevik  party itself. The repression of the strikes and Kronstadt revolt  effectively destroying hope for mass pressure for change from  below and the latter closing off the very last &quot;legal&quot; door for  those who opposed the regime from the left.</p>
<p>It could be argued that the Bolsheviks were still fighting peasant  insurrections and strikes across the country, but this has  everything to do with Bolshevik policies and could only be  considered <i>&quot;counter-revolutionary&quot;</i> if you think the Bolsheviks had a monopoly of what socialism and revolution meant. In the case of the Makhnovists in the Ukraine, the Bolsheviks started that conflict by betraying them once Wrangel had been defeated. As such, any resistance to Bolshevik rule by the working class and peasantry of Russia indicated the lack of democracy within the country rather than some sort of &quot;counter-revolutionary&quot; conflict.</p>
<p>So even the end of the Civil War causes problems for this  defence of the Bolsheviks. Simply put, with the defeat of the Whites it would be expected that some return to democratic norms would happen. It did not, in fact the reverse happened. Factions were banned, even the smallest forms of opposition  was finally eliminated from both the party and society as a whole. Those opposition groups and parties which had been  tolerated during the civil war were finally smashed. Popular revolts for reform, such as the Kronstadt rebellion and the strike wave which inspired it, were put down by force (see <a href="append42.html">&quot;What was the Kronstadt Rebellion?&quot;</a> on  these events). No form of opposition was  tolerated, no freedom allowed. If civil war <b>was</b> the cause  of Bolshevik authoritarianism, it seems strange that it got  worse after it was finished.</p>
<p>So, to conclude. Bolshevik authoritarianism did not begun with the start of the civil war. Anti-socialist policies were being implemented before it started. Similarly, these policies did not stop when the civil war ended, indeed the reverse happened. This, then, is the main factual problem with the <i>&quot;blame the civil  war&quot;</i> approach. Much of the worst of the suppression of working  class democracy either happened <b>before</b> the Civil War started  or <b>after</b> it had finished.</p>
<p>As we discuss in  <a href="append44.html">&quot;How did Bolshevik ideology contribute to the failure of the Revolution?&quot;</a>, the root   causes for Bolshevik  authoritarian post-October was Bolshevik ideology combined with  state power. After all, how &quot;democratic&quot; is it to give all power  to the Bolshevik party central committee? Surely socialism  involves more than voting for a new government? Is it not about  mass participation, the kind of participation centralised  government precludes and Bolshevism fears as being influenced  by <i>&quot;bourgeois ideology&quot;</i>? In such circumstances, moving from party  rule to party dictatorship is not such leap.</p>
<p>That &quot;civil war&quot; cannot explain what happened can be shown by a counter-example which effectively shows that civil war did not  inevitably mean party dictatorship over a state capitalist  economy (and protesting workers and peasants!). The Makhnovists  (an anarchist influenced partisan army) managed to defend the  revolution and encourage soviet democracy, freedom of speech,  and so on, while doing so (see the appendix <a href="append46.html">&quot;Why does the Makhnovist movement show there is   an alternative to Bolshevism?&quot;</a> discusses the Makhnovists  in some detail). In fact, the Bolsheviks tried to <b>ban</b> their  soviet congresses. Which, of course, does not really fit in  with the Bolsheviks being forced to be anti-democratic due to  the pressures of civil war.</p>
<p>So, in summary, civil war and imperialist intervention cannot be  blamed for Bolshevik authoritarianism simply because the latter had started before the former existed. Moreover, the example of the Makhnovists suggests that Bolshevik policies during the civil war were also not driven purely by the need for survival. As Kropotkin argued at the time, <i>&quot;all foreign armed intervention necessarily strengthens the dictatorial tendencies of the government . . . The evils inherent in a party dictatorship have been accentuated by the conditions of war in which this  party maintains its power. This state of war has been the pretext for strengthening dictatorial methods which centralise the control of every detail of life in the hands of the government, with the effect of stopping an immense part of the ordinary activity of the country. The evils natural to state communism have been  increased ten-fold under the pretext that all our misery is  due to foreign intervention.&quot;</i> [<b>Kropotkin's Revolutionary Pamphlets</b>, p. 253]</p>
<p>In other words, while the civil war may have increased Bolshevik  authoritarianism, it did not create it nor did it end with the  ending of hostilities.</p>

<h2>4 Did economic collapse and isolation destroy the revolution?</h2>
<p>One of the most common explanations for the failure revolution is that the Bolsheviks faced a terrible economic conditions, which  forced them to be less than democratic. Combined with the failure  of the revolution to spread to more advanced countries, party  dictatorship, it is argued, was inevitable. In the words of one Leninist:</p>
<blockquote><p><i> &quot;In a country where the working class was a minority of the population, where industry had been battered by years of war and in conditions of White and imperialist encirclement, the balance gradually titled towards greater coercion. Each step of the way was forced on the Bolsheviks by dire and pressing necessities.&quot;</i> [John Rees, <i>&quot;In Defence of October,&quot;</i> <b>International Socialism</b>, no. 52, p. 41]  </p></blockquote>
<p>He talks of <i>&quot;economic devastation&quot;</i> [p. 31] and quotes various sources, including Victor Serge. According to Serge, the  <i>&quot;decline in production was uninterrupted. It should be noted  that this decline had already begun before the revolution. In 1916 the output of agricultural machinery, for example, was down by 80 per cent compared with 1913. The year 1917 had been marked by a particularly general, rapid and serious downturn. The production figures for the principal industries in 1913 and 1918 were, in millions of <b>poods</b>: coal, from 1,738 to 731  (42 per cent); iron ore, from 57, 887 to 1,686; cast-iron,  from 256 to 31.5 (12.3 per cent); steel, from 259 to 24.5; rails, from 39.4 to 1.1. As a percentage of 1913 production,  output of linen fell to 75 per cent, of sugar to 24 per cent, and tobacco to 19 per cent.&quot;</i> Moreover, production continued  <i>&quot;to fall until the end of civil war . . . For 1920, the following  indices are given as a percentage of output in 1913: coal, 27  per cent; cast iron, 2.4 per cent; linen textiles, 38 per cent.&quot;</i>  [<b>Year One of the Russian Revolution</b>, p. 352 and p. 425]</p>
<p>According to Tony Cliff (another of Rees's references), the war-damaged industry <i>&quot;continued to run down&quot;</i> in the spring of 1918: <i>&quot;One of the causes of famine was the breakdown of  transport . . . Industry was in a state of complete collapse. Not only was there no food to feed the factory workers; there was no raw material or fuel for industry . . . The collapse of industry meant unemployment for the workers.&quot;</i> Cliff provides economic indexes. For large scale industry, taking 1913 as the base, 1917 saw production fall to 77%. In 1918, it was at 35% of the 1913 figure, 1919 it was 26% and 1920 was 18%.  Productivity per worker also fell, from 85% in 1917, to  44% in 1918, 22% in 1919 and then 26% in 1920. [<b>Lenin</b>, vol. 3, pp. 67-9, p. 86 and p. 85]</p>
<p>In such circumstances, it is argued, how can you expect the Bolsheviks to subscribe to democratic and socialist norms? This meant that the success or failure of the revolution depended on whether the revolution spread to more advanced countries. Leninist Duncan Hallas argues that the <i>&quot;failure of the German Revolution in 1918-19 . . . seems, in retrospect, to have been decisive . . . for only substantial economic aid from an advanced economy, in practice from a socialist  Germany, could have reversed the disintegration of the  Russian working class.&quot;</i> [<i>&quot;Towards a revolutionary socialist party,&quot;</i> pp. 38-55, <b>Party and Class</b>, Alex Callinicos (ed.), p. 44]</p>
<p>Anarchists are not convinced by these arguments. This is for two reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, we are aware that revolutions are disruptive no matter  where they occur (see  <a href="append43.html#app1">section 1</a>) Moreover, Leninists are meant to know this to. Simply put, there is a certain incredulous  element to these arguments. After all, Lenin himself had argued  that <i>&quot;[e]very revolution . . . by its very nature implies a  crisis, and a very deep crisis at that, both political and  economic. This is irrespective of the crisis brought about  by the war.&quot;</i> [<b>Collected Works</b>, vol. 30, p. 341] Serge  also considered crisis as inevitable, arguing that the <i>&quot;conquest of production by the proletariat was in itself a stupendous victory, one which saved the revolution's life.  Undoubtedly, so thorough a recasting of all the organs of production is impossible without a substantial decline in output; undoubtedly, too, a proletariat cannot labour and fight at the same time.&quot;</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 361] As we discussed in  detail in  <a href="append43.html#app2">section 2</a>,  this was a common Bolshevik position  at the time (which, in turn, belatedly echoed anarchist  arguments -- see  <a href="append43.html#app1">section 1</a>). And if we look at other  revolutions, we can say that this is the case.</p>
<p>Secondly, and more importantly, every revolution or near  revolutionary situation has been accompanied by economic crisis. For example, as we will shortly prove, Germany  itself was in a state of serious economic collapse in 1918  and 1919, a collapse which would have got worse is a  Bolshevik-style revolution had occurred there. This means that <b>if</b> Bolshevik authoritarianism is blamed on the  state of the economy, it is not hard to conclude that  <b>every</b> Bolshevik-style revolution will suffer the same fate as the Russian one.</p>
<p>As we noted in  <a href="append43.html#app1">section 1</a>, Kropotkin had argued from the 1880s that a revolution would be accompanied by economic  disruption. Looking at subsequent revolutions, he has been vindicated time and time again. Every revolution has been  marked by economic disruption and falling production. This suggests that the common Leninist idea that a successful revolution in, say, Germany would have ensured the success of the Russian Revolution is flawed. Looking at Europe  during the period immediately after the first world war, we  discover great economic hardship. To quote one Trotskyist  editor:</p>
<blockquote><p><i> &quot;In the major imperialist countries of Europe, production still had not recovered from wartime destruction. A limited economic upswing in 1919 and early 1920 enabled many demobilised  soldiers to find work, and unemployment fell somewhat.  Nonetheless, in 'victorious' France overall production in 1920 was still only two-thirds its pre-war level. In Germany industrial production was little more than half its 1914 level, human consumption of grains was down 44 per cent, and the economy was gripped by spiralling inflation. Average per capita wages in Prague in 1920, adjusted for inflation, were just over one-third of pre-war levels.&quot;</i> [John Riddell, <i>&quot;Introduction,&quot;</i> <b>Proceedings and Documents of the Second Congress, 1920</b>, vol. I, p. 17]  </p></blockquote>
<p>Now, if economic collapse was responsible for Bolshevik  authoritarianism and the subsequent failure of the revolution, it seems hard to understand why an expansion of the revolution into similarly crisis ridden countries would have had a major impact in the development of the revolution. Since most Leninists agree that the German Revolution, we will discuss this in more detail before going onto other revolutions.</p>
<p>By 1918, Germany was in a bad state. Victor Serge noted <i>&quot;the  famine and economic collapse which caused the final ruin of the Central Powers.&quot;</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 361] The semi-blockade of  Germany during the war badly effected the economy, the  <i>&quot;dynamic growth&quot;</i> of which before the war <i>&quot;had been largely  dependent on the country's involvement in the world market&quot;</i>.  The war <i>&quot;proved catastrophic to those who had depended on  the world market and had been involved in the production of  consumer goods . . . Slowly but surely the country slithered  into austerity and ultimately economic collapse.&quot;</i> Food  production suffered, with <i>&quot;overall food production declined  further after poor harvests in 1916 and 1917. Thus grain  production, already well below its prewar levels, slumped  from 21.8 million to 14.9 million tons in those two years.&quot;</i>  [V. R. Berghahn, <b>Modern Germany</b>, p. 47, pp. 47-8, p. 50]</p>
<p>The parallels with pre-revolution Russia are striking and  it is hardly surprising that revolution did break out in  Germany in November 1918. Workers' councils sprang up all  across the country, inspired in part by the example of the  Russian soviets (and what people <b>thought</b> was going on in  Russia under the Bolsheviks). A Social-Democratic government  was founded, which used the Free Corps (right-wing volunteer  troops) to crush the revolution from January 1919 onwards. This meant that Germany in 1919 was marked by extensive civil  war within the country. In January 1920, a state of siege  was re-introduced across half the country.</p>
<p>This social turmoil was matched by economic turmoil. As in  Russia, Germany faced massive economic problems, problems  which the revolution inherited. Taking 1928 as the base year,  the index of industrial production in Germany was slightly  lower in 1913, namely 98 in 1913 to 100 in 1928. In other  words, Germany effectively lost 15 years of economic  activity. In 1917, the index was 63 and by 1918 (the year  of the revolution), it was 61 (i.e. industrial production  had dropped by nearly 40%). In 1919, it fell again to 37,  rising to 54 in 1920 and 65 in 1921. Thus, in 1919, the  <i>&quot;industrial production reached an all-time low&quot;</i> and it  <i>&quot;took until the late 1920s for [food] production to recover  its 1912 level . . . In 1921 grain production was still . . .  some 30 per cent below the 1912 figure.&quot;</i> Coal production was 69.1% of its 1913 level in 1920, falling to 32.8% in 1923. Iron production was 33.1% in 1920 and 25.6% in 1923. Steel production likewise fell to 48.5% in 1920 and fell again to 36% in 1923. [V. R. Berghahn, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 258,  pp. 67-8, p. 71 and p. 259]</p>
<p>Significantly, one of the first acts of the Bolshevik government towards the new German government was to <i>&quot;the offer by the Soviet authorities of two trainloads of grain for the  hungry German population. It was a symbolical gesture and, in view of desperate shortages in Russia itself, a generous one.&quot;</i> The offer, perhaps unsurprisingly, was rejected in  favour of grain from America. [E.H. Carr, <b>The Bolshevik  Revolution</b>, vol. 3, p. 106]</p>
<p>The similarities between Germany and Russia are clear. As noted above, in Russia, the index for large scale industry  fell to 77 in 1917 from 100 in 1913, falling again to 35 in  1918, 26 in 1919 and 18 in 1920. [Tony Cliff, <b>Lenin</b>, vol. 3,  p. 86] In other words, a fall of 23% between 1913 and 1917,  54.5% between 1917 and 1918, 25.7% in 1918 and 30.8% in 1919.  A similar process occurred in Germany, where the fall  production was 37.7% between 1913 and 1917, 8.2% between  1917 and 1918 and 33.9% between 1918 and 1919 (the year of  revolution). While production did rise in 1920 by 45.9%,  production was still around 45% less than before the war.</p>
<p>Thus, comparing the two countries we discover a similar  picture of economic collapse. In the year the revolution started, production had fallen by 23% in Russia (from  1913 to 1917) and by 43% in Germany (from 1913 to 1918). Once revolution had effectively started, production fell even more. In Russia, it fell to 65% of its pre-war level in 1918, in Germany it fell to 62% of its pre-war level  in 1919. Of course, in Germany revolution did not go as far as in Russia, and so production did rise somewhat in  1920 and afterwards. What is significant is that in 1923, production fell dramatically by 34% (from around 70% of its pre-war level to around 45% of that level). This economic collapse did not deter the Communists from trying to provoke  a revolution in Germany that year, so suggesting that economic  disruption played no role in their evaluation of the success  of a revolution.</p>
<p>This economic chaos in Germany is never mentioned by Leninists when they discuss the <i>&quot;objective factors&quot;</i> facing the Russian Revolution. However, once these facts are taken into account, the superficiality of the typical Leninist explanation for the degeneration of the revolution becomes obvious. The very  problems which, it is claimed, forced the Bolsheviks to  act as they did also were rampant in Germany. If economic collapse made socialism impossible in Russia, it would  surely have had the same effect in Germany (and any social  revolution would also have faced more disruption than actually  faced post 1919 in Germany). This means, given that the economic  collapse in both 1918/19 and 1923 was as bad as that facing  Russia in 1918 and that the Bolsheviks had started to undermine  soviet and military democracy along with workers' control by  spring and summer of that year (see  <a href="append43.html#app5">section 5</a>), to blame  Bolshevik actions on economic collapse would mean that any  German revolution would have been subject to the same  authoritarianism <b>if</b> the roots of Bolshevik authoritarianism were forced by economic events rather than a product of applying a specific political ideology via state power. Few Leninists  draw this obvious conclusion from their own arguments although  there is no reason for them not to.</p>
<p>So the German Revolution was facing the same problems the  Russian one was. It seems unlikely, therefore, that a  successful German revolution would have been that much aid  to Russia. This means that when John Rees argues that giving machinery or goods to the peasants in return for grain instead  of simply seizing it required <i>&quot;revolution in Germany, or at least the revival of industry&quot;</i> in Russia, he completely fails to indicate the troubles facing the German revolution. <i>&quot;Without  a successful German revolution,&quot;</i> he writes, <i>&quot;the Bolsheviks  were thrown back into a bloody civil war with only limited  resources. The revolution was under siege.&quot;</i> [John Rees, <i>&quot;In  Defence of October,&quot;</i> pp. 3-82, <b>International Socialism</b>,  no. 52, p. 40 and p. 29] Yet given the state of the German  economy at the time, it is hard to see how much help a successful German revolution would have been. As such, his belief that a successful German Revolution would have mitigated Bolshevik authoritarianism seems exactly that, a belief without any real evidence to support it (and let us not forget, Bolshevik authoritarianism had started before the civil war broke out --  see  <a href="append43.html#app3">section 3</a>).  Moreover, <b>if</b> the pro-Bolshevik argument  Rees is expounding <b>is</b> correct, then the German Revolution  would have been subject to the same authoritarianism as befell  the Bolshevik one simply because it was facing a similar economic crisis. Luckily, anarchists argue, that this need not be the case if libertarian principles are applied in a revolution:</p>
<blockquote><p><i> &quot;The first months of emancipation will inevitably increase consumption of goods and production will diminish. And,  furthermore, any country achieving social revolution will be surrounded by a ring of neighbours either unfriendly or actually enemies . .  . The demands upon products will increase while production decreases, and finally famine will come. There is only one way of avoiding it. We should understand that as soon as a revolutionary movement begins in any country the only possible way out will consist in the workingmen [and women] and peasants from the beginning taking the whole national economy into their hands and organising it themselves . . .  But they will not be convinced of this necessity except when all responsibility for national economy, today in the hands of a multitude of ministers and committees, is presented in a simple form to each village and city, in every factory and shop, as their own affair, and when they understand that they must direct it themselves.&quot;</i> [<b>Kropotkin's Revolutionary Pamphlets</b>, pp. 77-8]  </p></blockquote>
<p>So, as regards the Russian and German revolution, Kropotkin's  arguments were proven correct. The same can be said of other  revolutions as well. Basing himself on the actual experiences  of both the French Revolution and the Paris Commune, we can  see why Kropotkin argued as he did. The Paris Commune, for  example, was born after a  four-month-long siege <i>&quot;had left  the capital in a state of economic collapse. The winter had  been the severest in living memory. Food and fuel had been  the main problems . . . Unemployment was widespread. Thousands  of demobilised soldiers wandered loose in Paris and joined in  the general hunt for food, shelter and warmth. For most working  men the only source of income was the 1.50 francs daily pay  of the National Guard, which in effect had become a form of  unemployment pay.&quot;</i> The city was <i>&quot;near starving&quot;</i> and by March  it was <i>&quot;in a state of economic and political crisis.&quot;</i> [Stewart  Edwards, <i>&quot;Introduction,&quot;</i> <b>The Communards of Paris, 1871</b>,  p. 23] Yet this economic collapse and isolation did not stop  the commune from introducing and maintaining democratic forms  of decision making, both political and economic. A similar process occurred during the French Revolution, where mass  participation via the <i>&quot;sections&quot;</i> was not hindered by economic collapse. It was finally stopped by state action organised by the Jacobins to destroy popular participation and initiative (see Kropotkin's <b>The Great French Revolution</b> for details).</p>
<p>During the Spanish Revolution, <i>&quot;overall Catalan production  fell in the first year of war by 30 per cent, and in the  cotton-working sector of the textile industry by twice as  much. Overall unemployment (complete and partial) rose by  nearly a quarter in the first year, and this despite the  military mobilisation decreed in September 1936. The cost of living quadrupled in just over two years; wages . . . only doubled.&quot;</i> [Ronald Fraser, <b>Blood of Spain</b>, p. 234]  Markets, both internally and externally, for goods and raw  materials were disrupted, not to mention the foreign blockade  and the difficulties imposed in trying to buy products from  other countries. These difficulties came on top of problems caused by the great depression of the 1930s which affected Spain along with most other countries. Yet, democratic norms  of economic and social decision making continued in spite of economic disruption. Ironically, given the subject of this discussion, it was only once the Stalinist counter-revolution  got going were they fatally undermined or destroyed.</p>
<p>Thus economic disruption need not automatically imply  authoritarian policies. And just as well, given the fact that revolution and economic disruption seem to go hand in hand.</p>
<p>Looking further afield, even <b>revolutionary</b> situations can be accompanied with economic collapse. For example, the  Argentine revolt which started in 2001 took place in the face of massive economic collapse. The economy was a mess, with  poverty and unemployment at disgusting levels. Four years of  recession saw the poverty rate balloon from 31 to 53 percent  of the population of 37 million, while unemployment climbed  from 14 to 21.4 percent, according to official figures. Yet in the face of such economic problems, working class people acted collectively, forming popular assemblies and taking  over workplaces.</p>
<p>The Great Depression of the 1930s in America saw a much deeper economic contradiction. Indeed, it was as bad as that associated with revolutionary Germany and Russia after the first world war. According to Howard Zinn, after the stock market crash in 1929 <i>&quot;the economy was stunned, barely moving. Over five thousand banks closed and huge numbers of businesses, unable to get money, closed too. Those that continued laid off employees and cut the wages of those who remained, again and again. Industrial production fell by 50 percent, and by 1933 perhaps 15 million (no knew exactly) -- one-forth or one-third of the labour force --  were out of work.&quot;</i> [<b>A People's History of the  United States</b>, p. 378]</p>
<p>Specific industries were badly affected. For example, total GNP  fell to 53.6% in 1933 compared to its 1929 value. The production  of basic goods fell by much more. Iron and Steel saw a 59.3%  decline, machinery a 61.6% decline and <i>&quot;non-ferrous metals and  products&quot;</i> a 55.9% decline. Transport was also affected, with  transportation equipment declining by 64.2% railroad car  production dropping by 73.6% and locomotion production declining  by 86.4%. Furniture production saw a decline of 57.9%. The  workforce was equally affected, with unemployment reaching 25% in 1933. In Chicago 40% of the workforce was unemployed. Union membership, which had fallen from 5 million in 1920 to 3.4 million in 1929 fell to less than 3 million by 1933. [Lester  V. Chandler, <b>America's Greatest Depression, 1929-1941</b>, p. 20, p. 23, p. 34, p. 45 and p. 228]</p>
<p>Yet in the face of this economic collapse, no Leninist proclaimed the impossibility of socialism. In fact, the reverse what the case. Similar arguments could apply to, say, post-world war two Europe, when economic collapse and war damage did not stop Trotskyists looking forward to, and seeking, revolutions there. Nor did the massive economic that occurred after the fall of Stalinism in  Russia in the early 1990s deter Leninist calls for revolution.  Indeed, you can rest assured that any drop in economic activity,  no matter how large or small, will be accompanied by Leninist  articles arguing for the immediate introduction of socialism. And this was the case in 1917 as well, when economic crisis had  been a fact of Russian life throughout the year. Lenin, for  example, argued at the end of September of that <i>&quot;Russia is  threatened with an inevitable catastrophe . . .A catastrophe  of extraordinary dimensions, and a famine, are unavoidably  threatening . . . Half a year of revolution has passed. The  catastrophe has come still closer. Things have come to a state  of mass unemployment. Think of it: the country is suffering from  a lack of commodities.&quot;</i> [<b>The Threatening Catastrophe and how to Fight It</b>, p. 5] This did not stop him calling for revolution and seizing power. Nor did this crisis stop the creation of  democratic working class organisations, such as soviets, trade  unions and factory committees being formed. It did not stop mass  collective action to combat those difficulties. It appears,  therefore, that while the economic crisis of 1917 did not stop  the development of socialist tendencies to combat it, the  seizure of power by a socialist party did.</p>
<p>Given that no Leninist has argued that a revolution could take place in Germany after the war or in the USA during the darkest months of the Great Depression, the argument that the grim economic conditions facing Bolshevik Russia made soviet democracy impossible seem weak. By arguing that both Germany and the USA could create a viable socialist revolution in economic conditions just as bad as those facing Soviet Russia, the reasons why the Bolsheviks created a party dictatorship must be looked for elsewhere. Given this support for revolution in 1930s America and post-world war I and II Europe, you would have to conclude that, for Leninists,  economic collapse only makes socialism impossible once <b>they</b> are  in power! Which is hardly convincing, or inspiring.</p>
<p><a name="app5"></a></p>
<h2>5 Was the Russian working class atomised or <i>&quot;declassed&quot;</i>?</h2>
<p>A standard Leninist explanation for the dictatorship of the Bolshevik party (and subsequent rise of Stalinism) is based on the <i>&quot;atomisation&quot;</i> or <i>&quot;declassing&quot;</i> of the proletariat. John Rees summarises this argument as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p><i> &quot;The civil war had reduced industry to rubble. The working  class base of the workers' state, mobilises time and again to defeat the Whites, the rock on which Bolshevik power  stood, had disintegrated. The Bolsheviks survived three  years of civil war and wars in intervention, but only at the cost of reducing the working class to an atomised, individualised mass, a fraction of its former size, and no longer able to exercise the collective power that it had done in 1917 . . . The bureaucracy of the workers' state was left suspended in mid-air, its class base  eroded and demoralised. Such conditions could not help but have an effect on the machinery of the state and organisation of the Bolshevik Party.&quot;</i> [<i>&quot;In Defence of  October,&quot;</i> pp. 3-82, <b>International Socialism</b>, no. 52, p. 65]  </p></blockquote>
<p>It is these objective factors which, it is argued, explain why the Bolshevik party substituted itself for the Russian working class. <i>&quot;Under such conditions,&quot;</i> argues Tony Cliff, <i>&quot;the class base of the Bolshevik Party disintegrated -- not because of  some mistakes in the policies of Bolshevism, not because of one or another conception of Bolshevism regarding the role of the party and its relation to the class -- but because of mightier historical factors. The working class had become declassed . . . Bolshevik 'substitutionism' . . . did not jump out of Lenin's head as Minerva out of Zeus's, but was born of the objective conditions of civil war in a peasant country, where a small working class, reduced in weight, became fragmented and  dissolved into the peasant masses.&quot;</i> [<b>Trotsky on Substitutionism</b>, pp. 62-3] In other words, because the working class was so  decimated the replacement of class power by party power was  inevitable.</p>
<p>Before discussing this argument, we should point out that this argument dates back to Lenin. For example, he argued in 1921 that the proletariat, <i>&quot;owning to the war and to the desperate  poverty and ruin, has become declassed, i.e. dislodged from its class groove, and had ceased to exist as proletariat . . . the proletariat has disappeared.&quot;</i> [<b>Collected Works</b>, vol. 33, p. 66] However, unlike his later-day followers, Lenin was sure that while it <i>&quot;would be absurd and ridiculous to deny that the  fact that the proletariat is declassed is a handicap&quot;</i> it could  still <i>&quot;fulfil its task of wining and holding state power.&quot;</i>  [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, vol. 32, p. 412] As we will see, the context in which Lenin started to make these arguments is important.</p>
<p>Anarchists do not find these arguments particularly convincing. This is for two reasons. Firstly, it seems incredulous to  blame the civil war for the <i>&quot;substitution&quot;</i> of Bolshevik power for working class power as party power had been Lenin's stated aim in 1917 and October saw the seizure of power by the  Bolsheviks, <b>not</b> the soviets. As we saw in  <a href="append43.html#app3">section 3</a>,  the Bolsheviks started to gerrymander and disband soviets to remain in power <b>before</b> the civil war started. As such, to blame the civil war and the problems it caused for the usurpation of power by the Bolsheviks seems unconvincing. Simply put, the Bolsheviks had <i>&quot;substituted&quot;</i> itself for the proletariat from the start, from the day it seized power in the October revolution.</p>
<p>Secondly, the fact is the Russian working class was far from <i>&quot;atomised.&quot;</i> Rather than being incapable of collective action, as Leninists assert, Russia's workers were more than capable of taking collective action throughout the civil war period. The problem is, of course, that any such collective action was directed <b>against</b> the Bolshevik party. This caused the party no end of problems. After all, if the working class  <b>was</b> the ruling class under the Bolsheviks, then who was it striking against? Emma Goldman explains the issue well:</p>
<blockquote><p><i> &quot;In my early period the question of strikes had puzzled me a great deal. People had told me that the least attempt of that kind was crushed and the participants sent to prison. I had not believed it, and, as in all similar things, I  turned to Zorin [a Bolshevik] for information. 'Strikes under  the dictatorship of the proletariat!' he had proclaimed; 'there's no such thing.' He had even upbraided me for  crediting such wild and impossible tales. Against whom,  indeed, should the workers strike in Soviet Russia, he argued. Against themselves? They were the masters of the country, politically as well as industrially. To be sure, there were some among the toilers who were not yet fully class-conscious and aware of their own true interests. These were sometimes disgruntled, but they were elements incited by . . . self-seekers and enemies of the Revolution.&quot;</i> [<b>Living My Life</b>, vol. 2, p. 872]  </p></blockquote>
<p>This, unfortunately, still seems to be the case in pro-Bolshevik accounts of the Revolution and its degeneration. After the Bolshevik seizure of power, the working class as an active agent almost immediately disappears from the accounts. This is unsurprising, as it does not bode well for maintaining the Bolshevik Myth to admit that workers were resisting the  so-called <i>&quot;proletarian dictatorship&quot;</i> from the start. The notion that the working class had <i>&quot;disappeared&quot;</i> fits into this selective blindness well. Why discuss the actions of a class which did not exist? Thus we have a logical circle from which reality can be excluded: the working class is <i>&quot;atomised&quot;</i> and so cannot take industrial action, evidence of industrial action need not be looked for because the class is <i>&quot;atomised.&quot;</i></p>
<p>This can be seen from Lenin. For example, he proclaimed in  October 1921 that <i>&quot;the proletariat had disappeared.&quot;</i> Yet this non-existent class had, in early 1921, taken collective action which <i>&quot;encompassed most of the country's industrial regions.&quot;</i> [J. Aves, <b>Workers Against Lenin</b>, p. 111]  Significantly, the Communists (then and now) refused to call  the movement a strike, preferring the word <i>&quot;volynka&quot;</i> which means <i>&quot;go-slow.&quot;</i> The Menshevik leader Dan explained why: <i>&quot;The Bolshevik press carefully tried, at first, to hush up the movement, then to hide its real size and character.  Instead of calling the strike a strike, they thought up various new terms -- <b>yolynka,</b> <b>buza</b> and so on.&quot;</i> [quoted by Aves, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 112] As Russian anarchist Ida Mett  succinctly put it: <i>&quot;And if the proletariat was that exhausted  how come it was still capable of waging virtually total general  strikes in the largest and most heavily industrialised cities?&quot;</i>  [Ida Mett, <b>The Kronstadt Rebellion</b>, p. 81]</p>
<p>The year after Lenin proclaimed the proletariat <i>&quot;disappeared&quot;</i> we discover similar evidence of working class collective action. Ironically, it is Leninist Tony Cliff who presents the evidence that <i>&quot;the number of workers involved in labour  conflicts was three and a half million, and in 1923, 1,592,800.&quot;</i>  Strikes in state-owned workplaces in 1922 involved 192,000  workers. [<b>State Capitalism in Russia</b>, p. 28] Given that Cliff states that in 1921 there was only <i>&quot;one and a quarter million&quot;</i> industrial workers <i>&quot;proper&quot;</i> (compared to over  three million in 1917), this level of strikes is extremely large -- particular for members of a class which did not, according to Lenin which had <i>&quot;disappeared&quot;</i>!</p>
<p>Before providing more evidence for the existence of working class collective struggle throughout the period 1918 to 1923, it is necessary to place Lenin's comments on the <i>&quot;declassing&quot;</i> of the working class in context. Rather than being the result of a lack of industrial protest, Lenin's arguments were the product of its opposite -- the rise in collective struggle by the Russian working class. As one historian notes: <i>&quot;As  discontent amongst workers became more and more difficult to  ignore, Lenin . . . began to argue that the consciousness of  the working class had deteriorated . . . workers had become  'declassed.'&quot;</i> <i>&quot;Lenin's analysis,&quot;</i> he continues, <i>&quot;had a  superficial logic but it was based on a false conception of working-class consciousness. There is little evidence to suggest  that the demands that workers made at the end of 1920 . . .  represented a fundamental change in aspirations since 1917 . . . [Moreover] an analysis of the industrial unrest in 1921  shows that long-standing workers were prominent in protest.&quot;</i> [J. Aves, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 90 and pp. 90-1]</p>
<p>Lenin's pessimistic analysis of 1921 is in sharp contrast to the optimistic mood of early 1920, reproduced by the defeat of the White armies, in Bolshevik ranks. For example, writing  in May, 1920, Trotsky seemed oblivious to the <i>&quot;atomisation&quot;</i>  of the Russian working class, arguing that <i>&quot;in spite of  political tortures, physical sufferings and horrors, the  labouring masses are infinitely distinct from political decomposition, from moral collapse, or from apathy . . . Today,  in all branches of industry, there is going on an energetic  struggle for the establishment of strict labour discipline,  and for the increase of the productivity of labour. The party  organisations, the trade unions, the factory and workshop  administrative committees, rival each one another in this  respect, with the undivided support of the working class as a whole.&quot;</i> Indeed, they <i>&quot;concentrate their attention and will  on collective problems&quot;</i> (<i>&quot;Thanks to a regime which . . .  given their life a pursue&quot;</i>!). Needless to say, the party had  <i>&quot;the undivided support of the public opinion of the working  class as a whole.&quot;</i> [<b>Terrorism and Communism</b>, p. 6]</p>
<p>The turn around in perspective after this period did not happen by accident, independently of the working class resistance to Bolshevik rule. After all, the defeat of the Whites in early of 1920 saw the Bolsheviks take <i>&quot;victory as a sign of the  correctness of its ideological approach and set about the task  of reconstruction on the basis of an intensification of War Communism policies with redoubled determination.&quot;</i> This led to <i>&quot;an increase in industrial unrest in 1920,&quot;</i> including  <i>&quot;serious strikes.&quot;</i> The resistance was <i>&quot;becoming increasingly politicised.&quot;</i> Thus, the stage was set for Lenin's turn around and his talk of <i>&quot;declassing.&quot;</i> In early 1921 <i>&quot;Lenin argued that  workers, who were no more demoralised than they were in early  1920, had become 'declassed' in order to justify a political  clamp-down.&quot;</i> [J. Aves, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 37, p. 80 and p. 18]</p>
<p>Other historians also note this context. For example, while the  <i>&quot;working class had decreased in size and changed in composition, . . . the protest movement from late 1920 made clear that it was  not a negligible force and that in an inchoate way it retained a  vision of socialism which was not identified entirely with Bolshevik  power . . . Lenin's arguments on the declassing of the proletariat  was more a way of avoiding this unpleasant truth than a real  reflection of what remained, in Moscow at least, a substantial  physical and ideological force.&quot;</i> [Richard Sakwa,  Soviet  Communists in Power, p. 261] In the words of Diane Koenker, <i>&quot;[i]f Lenin's perceptions of the situation were at all  representative, it appears that the Bolshevik party made  deurbanisation and declassing the scapegoat for its political difficulties, when the party's own policies and its unwillingness to accept changing proletarian attitudes were also to blame.&quot;</i> Ironically, this was not the first time that the Bolsheviks had blamed its problems on the lack of a <i>&quot;true&quot;</i> proletariat and its replacement by &quot;petty-bourgeois&quot; elements, <i>&quot;[t]his was the same argument used to explain the Bolsheviks' lack of success in the early months of 1917 -- that the cadres of conscious proletarians were diluted by non-proletarian  elements.&quot;</i> [<i>&quot;Urbanisation and Deurbanisation in the Russian Revolution and Civil War,&quot;</i> pp. 424-450, <b>The Journal of  Modern History</b>, vol. 57, no. 3, p. 449 and p. 428]</p>
<p>It should be noted that the <i>&quot;declassing&quot;</i> argument does have a  superficial validity if you accept the logic of vanguardism. After all, if you accept the premise that the party alone  represents socialist consciousness and that the working class, by its own efforts, can only reach a reformist level of  political conscious (at best), then any deviation in working  class support for the party obviously represents a drop in  class consciousness or a <i>&quot;declassing&quot;</i> of the proletariat (see  section H.5.1 -- <i><a href="secH5.html#sech51">&quot;Why are  vanguard parties anti-socialist?&quot;</a></i>). Thus working class protest against the party can be dismissed as evidence of <i>&quot;declassing&quot;</i> which has to be suppressed rather  than what it really is, namely evidence of working class  autonomy and collective struggle for what it considers <b>its</b>  interests to be against a new master class. In fact, the <i>&quot;declassing&quot;</i> argument is related to the vanguardist position which, in turn, justifies the dictatorship of the party <b>over</b> the class (see section H.5.3 -- <i><a href="secH5.html#sech53">&quot;Why  does vanguardism imply party power?&quot;</a></i>).</p>
<p>So the <i>&quot;declassing&quot;</i> argument is not some neutral statement of fact. It was developed as a weapon on the class struggle, to justify Bolshevik repression of collective working class  struggle. To justify the continuation of Bolshevik party dictatorship <b>over</b> the working class. This in turn explains  why working class struggle during this period generally fails  to get mentioned by later day Bolsheviks -- it simply undermines  their justifications for Bolshevik dictatorship. After all,  how can they say that the working class could not exercise <i>&quot;collective power&quot;</i> when it was conducting mass strikes  throughout Russia during the period 1918 to 1923?</p>
<p>As such, it does not seem that strange that in most Leninist  account of the revolution post-October rarely, if ever, mention  what the working class was actually doing. We do get statistics  on the drop of the numbers of industrial workers in the cities  (usually Petrograd and Moscow), but any discussion on working  class protest and strikes is generally, at best, mentioned in  passing or, usually, ignored utterly. Given this was meant to  be a <i>&quot;proletarian&quot;</i> dictatorship, it seems strange this silence.  It could be argued that this silence is due to the working class  being decimated in number and/or <i>&quot;declassed&quot;</i> in terms of itself perspective. This, however, seems unlikely, as collective working  class protest was common place in Bolshevik Russia. The silence  can be better understood by the fact this protest was directed  <b>against</b> the Bolsheviks.</p>
<p>Which shows the bankruptcy of what can be called the <i>&quot;statistical tendency&quot;</i> of analysing the Russian working class. While statistics can tell us how many workers remained in Russia in, say, 1921,  it does not prove any idea of their combativeness or their  ability to take collective decisions and action. If numbers alone  indicated the ability of workers to take part in collective  struggle, then the massive labour struggles in 1930s American  would not have taken place. Millions had been made redundant.  At the Ford Motor Company, 128,000 workers had been employed in  the spring of 1929. There were only 37,000 by August of 1931 (only  29% of the 1929 figure). By the end of 1930, almost half of the  280,000 textile mill workers in New England were out of work.  [Howard Zinn, <b>A People's History of the United States</b>, p. 378]  Yet in the face of these massive redundancies, the workers organised  themselves and fought back. As we will indicate, the reduction in the number of Russian workers did not restrict their ability to make collective decisions and act collectively on them -- Bolshevik repression <b>did.</b></p>
<p>Moreover, while Leninists usually point to the fall in population in  Petrograd and Moscow during the civil war, concentrating on  these cities can be misleading. <i>&quot;Using the Petrograd figures,&quot;</i>  notes Daniel R. Bower, <i>&quot;historians have painted a lurid picture of  flight from the cities. In 1918 alone the former capital lost 850,000 people and was by itself responsible for  one-half of the total urban population decline of the Civil War years. If one sets aside aggregate figures to determine the trend characteristic of most cities, however, the experiences of Petrograd appears exception. Only a handful of cities . . . lost half their population between 1917 and 1920, and even Moscow, which declined by over 40 percent, was not typical of most towns in the northern, food-importing areas. A study of all cities . . . found that the average decline in the north (167 towns in all, excluding the capital cities) amounted to 24 percent  between 1917 and 1920. Among the towns in the food-producing areas in the southern and eastern regions of the Russian Republic (a total of 128), the average decline came to only 14 percent.&quot;</i> [<i>&quot;'The city in danger': The Civil War and the Russian Urban Population,&quot;</i> <b>Party, State, and  Society in the Russian Civil War</b>, Diane P. Koenker,  William G. Rosenberg and Ronald Grigor Suny (eds.),  p. 61] Does this mean that the possibility of soviet  democracy declined less in these towns? Yet the Bolsheviks applied their dictatorships even there, suggesting that declining urban populations was not the source of their authoritarianism.</p>
<p>Equally, what are we to make of towns and cities which  increased their populations? Some towns and cites actually  grew in size. For example, Minsk, Samara, Khar'kov, Tiflis, Baku,  Rostov-on-don, Tsaritsyn and Perm all grew in population  (often by significant amounts) between 1910 and 1920 while other cities shrunk. [Diane Koenker, <i>&quot;Urbanisation and Deurbanisation  in the Russian Revolution and Civil War,&quot;</i> pp. 424-450, <b>The  Journal of Modern History</b>, vol. 57, no. 3, p. 425] Does that mention soviet democracy was possible in those towns but not in Petrograd or Moscow? Or does the fact that the industrial  workforce grew by 14.8% between October 1920 and April 1921  mean that the possibility for soviet democracy also grew by  a similar percentage? [J. Aves, <b>Workers Against Lenin</b>,  p. 159]</p>
<p>Then there is the question of when the reduction of workers makes soviet democracy impossible. After all, between May 1917  and April 1918 the city of Moscow lost 300,000 of its two million inhabitants. Was soviet democracy impossible in April 1918 because of this? During the civil war, Moscow lost  another 700,000 by 1920 (which is basically the same amount per year). [Diane Koenker, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 424] When did this  fall in population mean that soviet democracy was impossible? Simply put, comparing figures of one year to another simply fails to understand the dynamics at work, such as the impact  of <i>&quot;reasons of state&quot;</i> and working class resistance to Bolshevik rule. It, in effect, turns the attention away from the state of working class autonomy and onto number crunching.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the question of whether the working class was too <i>&quot;atomised&quot;</i> to govern can only be answered by looking at the class struggle in Russia during this period, by looking at the strikes, demonstrations and protests that occurred. Something Leninists rarely do. Needless to say, certain  strike waves just cannot be ignored. The most obvious case  is in Petrograd just before the Kronstadt revolt in early  1921. After all, the strikes (and subsequent Bolshevik  repression) inspired the sailors to revolt in solidarity  with them. Faced with such events, the scale of the protest  and Bolshevik repression is understated and the subject quickly  changed. As we noted in  <a href="append42.html#app10">section 10</a> of the appendix on <a href="append42.html">&quot;What was the Kronstadt Rebellion?&quot;</a>, John Rees states that  Kronstadt was <i>&quot;preceded by a wave of serious but quickly  resolved strikes.&quot;</i> [Rees, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 61] Needless to say,  he does not mention that the strikes were <i>&quot;resolved&quot;</i> by  <i>&quot;serious&quot;</i> force. Nor does he explain how <i>&quot;an atomised,  individualised mass&quot;</i> <b>could</b> conduct such <i>&quot;serious&quot;</i> strikes,  strikes which required martial law to break. Little wonder,  then, Rees does expound on the strikes and what they meant  in terms of the revolution and his own argument.</p>
<p>Similarly, we find Victor Serge arguing that the <i>&quot;working class  often fretted and cursed; sometimes it lent an ear to the Menshevik  agitators, as in the great strikes at Petrograd in the spring of  1919. But once the choice was posed as that between the dictatorship  of the White Generals and the dictatorship of its own party -- and  there was not and could not be any other choice -- every fit man  . . . came to stand . . . before the windows of the local party  offices.&quot;</i> [<b>Year One of the Russian Revolution</b>, pp. 365-6] An  exhausted and atomised working class capable of <i>&quot;great strikes&quot;</i>?  That seems unlikely. Significantly, Serge does not mention the  Bolshevik acts of repression used against the rebel workers (see  below). This omission cannot help distort any conclusions to be drawn from his account.</p>
<p>Which, incidentally, shows that the civil war was not all bad news for the Bolsheviks. Faced with working class protest, they could play the <i>&quot;White card&quot;</i> -- unless the workers went back to work, the Whites would win. This explains why the strikes of early 1921  were larger than before and explains why they were so important. As the <i>&quot;White card&quot;</i> could no longer be played, the Bolshevik  repression could not be excused in terms of the civil war. Indeed, given working class opposition to the party, it would be fair to  say that civil war actually <b>helped</b> the Bolsheviks remain in power.  Without the threat of the Whites, the working class would <b>not</b> have  tolerated the Bolsheviks longer than the Autumn of 1918.</p>
<p>The fact is that working class collective struggle against the new regime and, consequently, Bolshevik repression, started before the  outbreak of the civil war. It continued throughout the civil war period and reached a climax in the early months of 1921. Even the repression of the Kronstadt rebellion did not stop it, with strikes continuing into 1923 (and, to a lesser degree, afterward). Indeed, the history of the <i>&quot;workers' state&quot;</i> is a history of the state  repressing the revolt of the workers.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it would be impossible to give a full account of working class resistance to Bolshevism. All we can do here is give a flavour of what was happening and the sources for further information. What should be clear from our account is that the  idea that the working class in this period was incapable of  collective organisation and struggle is false. As such, the idea that Bolshevik <i>&quot;substitutionism&quot;</i> can be explained in such term is also false. In addition, it will become clear that Bolshevik  repression explicitly aimed to break the ability of workers to organise and exercise collective power. As such, it seems  hypocritical for modern-day Leninists to blame Bolshevik power  on the <i>&quot;atomisation&quot;</i> of the working class when Bolshevik power  was dependent on smashing working class collective organisation  and resistance. Simply put, to remain in power Bolshevism, from the start, had to crush working class power. This is to be  expected, given the centralised nature of the state and the assumptions of vanguardism. If you like, October 1917 did not see the end of <i>&quot;dual power.&quot;</i> Rather the Bolshevik state replaced the bourgeois state and working class power (as expressed in its collective struggle) came into conflict with it.</p>
<p>This struggle of the <i>&quot;workers' state&quot;</i> against the workers started early in 1918. <i>&quot;By the early summer of 1918,&quot;</i> records one historian,  <i>&quot;there were widespread anti-Bolshevik protests. Armed clashes  occurred in the factory districts of Petrograd and other industrial  centres. Under the aegis of the Conference of Factory and Plant Representatives . . . a general strike was set for July 2.&quot;</i>  [William Rosenberg, <i>&quot;Russian labour and Bolshevik Power,&quot;</i>  pp. 98-131, <b>The Workers' revolution in Russia</b>, 1917, Daniel H.  Kaiser (ed.), p. 107] According to another historian, economic  factors <i>&quot;were soon to erode the standing of the Bolsheviks  among Petrograd workers . . .  These developments, in turn,  led in short order to worker protests, which then precipitated  violent repressions against hostile workers. Such treatment  further intensified the disenchantment of significant segments  of Petrograd labour with Bolshevik-dominated Soviet rule.&quot;</i>  [Alexander Rabinowitch, <b>Early Disenchantment with Bolshevik  Rule</b>, p. 37]</p>
<p>The reasons for these protest movement were both political and economic. The deepening economic crisis combined with protests against Bolshevik authoritarianism to produce a wave of strikes aiming for political change. Feeling that the soviets were  distant and unresponsive to their needs (with good reason, given Bolshevik postponement of soviet elections and gerrymandering of the soviets), workers turned to direct action and the  initially Menshevik inspired <i>&quot;Conference of Factory and Plant Representatives&quot;</i> (also known as the <i>&quot;Extraordinary Assembly of  Delegates from Petrograd Factories and Plants&quot;</i>) to voice their  concerns. At its peak, reports <i>&quot;estimated that out of 146,000  workers still in Petrograd, as many as 100,000 supported the  conference's goals.&quot;</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 127] The aim of the Conference (as per Menshevik policy) was to reform the existing system  <i>&quot;from within&quot;</i> and, as such, the Conference operated openly. As Alexander Rabinowitch notes, <i>&quot;[F]or the Soviet authorities  in Petrograd, the rise of the Extraordinary Assembly of  Delegates from Petrograd Factories and Plants was an ominous  portent of worker defection.&quot;</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 37]</p>
<p>The first wave of outrage and protests occurred after Bolshevik  Red Guards opened fire on a demonstration for the Constituent  Assembly in early January (killing 21, according to Bolshevik  sources). This demonstration <i>&quot;was notable as the first time  workers came out actively against the new regime. More ominously,  it was also the first time forces representing soviet power used violence against workers.&quot;</i> [David Mandel, <b>The Petrograd Workers  and the Soviet Seizure of Power</b>, p. 355] It would not be the last -- indeed repression by the <i>&quot;workers' state&quot;</i> of working  class protest became a recurring feature of Bolshevism.</p>
<p>By April <i>&quot;it appeared that the government was now ready to go to  whatever extremes it deemed necessary (including sanctioning the  arrest and even shooting of workers) to quell labour unrest. This  in turn led to intimidation, apathy, lethargy and passivity of  other workers. In these circumstances, growth in support of the  Assembly slowed down.&quot;</i> [Rabinowitch, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 40] The Assembly aborted its plans for a May Day demonstration to protest the government's policies were cancelled because of workers did not respond to the appeals to demonstrate (in part because of  <i>&quot;Bolshevik threats against 'protesters'&quot;</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, pp. 40-1]).</p>
<p>This apathy did not last long. After early May events <i>&quot;served  to reinvigorate and temporarily radicalise the Assembly. These  developments included yet another drastic drop in food supplies,  the shooting of protesting housewives and workers in the Petrograd suburb of Kolpino, the arbitrary arrest and abuse of  workers in another Petrograd suburb, Sestroresk, the closure of  newspapers and the arrests of individuals who had denounced the  Kolpino and Sestroresk events, the intensification of labour  unrest and conflict with the authorities in the Obukhov plant  and in other Petrograd factories and districts.&quot;</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>,  p. 41]</p>
<p>So the next major protest wave occurred in early May, 1918, after  armed guards opened fire on protesting workers in Kolpino --  <i>&quot;while the incident was hardly the first of its kind, it  triggered a massive wave of indignation.&quot;</i> Work temporarily  stopped in a number of plants. Between Kolpino and early July,  more than seventy incidents occurred in Petrograd, including  strikes, demonstrations and anti-Bolshevik meetings. Many of  these meetings <i>&quot;were protests against some form of Bolshevik  repression: shootings, incidents of 'terroristic activities,'  and arrests.&quot;</i> In some forty incidents <i>&quot;worker's protests  focused on these issues, and the data is surely understate  the actual number by a wide margin. There were as well some  eighteen separate strikes or some other work stoppages with  an explicitly anti-Bolshevik character.&quot;</i> [Rosenberg, <b>Op. Cit.</b>,  p. 123 and pp. 123-4] Then, <i>&quot;[a]t the very end of May and the  beginning of June, when a wave of strikes to protest at bread  shortages broke out in the Nevskii district, a majority of  Assembly delegates . . . resolved to call on striking Nevskii  district workers to return to work and continue preparation  for a general city-wide strike.&quot;</i> [Rabinowitch, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 42] Unfortunately, for the Assembly postponing the strikes until a <i>&quot;better time&quot;</i> rather than encouraging them gave the authorities time to prepare.</p>
<p>Things came to a head during and after the soviet elections in June. On June 20th the Obukhov works issued an appeal to the  Conference of Factory and Plant Representatives <i>&quot;to declare a  one-day strike of protest on June 25th&quot;</i> against Bolshevik  reprisals for the assassination of a leading Bolshevik. <i>&quot;The  Bolsheviks responded by 'invading' the whole Nevskii district  with troops and shutting down Obukhov completely. Meetings  everywhere were forbidden.&quot;</i> The workers were not intimidated and <i>&quot;[i]n scores of additional factories and shops protests mounted and rapidly spread along the railroads.&quot;</i> At the June 26th <i>&quot;extraordinary session&quot;</i> of the Conference a general strike was declared for July 2nd. Faced with this, the Bolsheviks set up  <i>&quot;machine guns . . . at main points throughout the Petrograd and  Moscow railroad junctions, and elsewhere in both cities as well.  Controls were tightened in factories. Meetings were forcefully  dispersed.&quot;</i> [Rosenberg, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, pp. 126-7 and p. 127] In other words, <i>&quot;as a result of extreme government intimidation,  the response to the Assembly's strike call on 2 July was  negligible.&quot;</i> [Rabinowitch, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 42] This repression was not trivial:</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>&quot;Among other things, all newspapers were forced to print on their front pages Petrograd soviet resolutions condemning the Assembly as part of the domestic and foreign counter-revolution. Factories participating in the strike were warned that they would be shut down and individual strikers were threatened with the loss of work -- threats that were subsequently made good. Printing plants suspected of opposition sympathies were sealed, the offices of hostile trade unions were raided,  martial law declared on rail lines, and armed strike-breaking patrols with authority to take whatever action was necessary to prevent work stoppages were formed and put on 24-hour duty at key points throughout Petrograd.&quot;</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 45]  </p></blockquote>
<p>Needless to say, <i>&quot;the Petrograd authorities drew on the dubious  mandate provided by the stacked soviet elections to justify  banning the Extraordinary Assembly.&quot;</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 42] While the Bolsheviks had won around 50% of workplace votes, as we note in <a href="append41.html#app6">section 6</a> of the appendix  on <a href="append41.html">&quot;What happened during the Russian Revolution?&quot;</a> they had gerrymandered the soviet making the election results irrelevant. The fact the civil war had started undoubtedly aided the Bolsheviks during this election and the fact that the Mensheviks and SRs had campaigned on a platform to win the soviet elections as the means of replacing soviet democracy by the Constituent Assembly. Many workers still viewed the soviets are <b>their</b> organisations and aimed for a functioning soviet system rather than its end.</p>
<p>The Bolsheviks turned on the Conference, both locally and  nationally, and arrested its leading activists, so decapitating  the only independent working class organisation left in Russia. As Rabinowitch argues, <i>&quot;the Soviet authorities were profoundly  worried by the threat posed by the Assembly and fully aware if  their growing isolation from workers (their only real social  base) . . . Petrograd Bolsheviks developed a siege mentality  and a corresponding disposition to consider any action -- from  suppression of the opposition press and manipulation of elections to terror even against workers -- to be justified in the struggle to retain power until the start of the imminent world revolution.&quot;</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, pp. 43-4]</p>
<p>Similar events happened in other cities. As we discuss in  <a href="append41.html#app6">section 6</a> of the appendix on <a href="append41.html">&quot;What happened during the Russian Revolution?&quot;</a>, the Bolsheviks had disbanded soviets   elected with non-Bolshevik majorities all across Russia and suppressed  the resulting working class protest. In Moscow, workers also organised a <i>&quot;Conference&quot;</i> movement and <i>&quot;[r]esentment against  the Bolsheviks was expressed through strikes and disturbances,  which the authorities treated as arising from supply  difficulties, from 'lack of consciousness,' and because of  the 'criminal demagogy' of certain elements. Lack of support  for current Bolshevik practices was treated as the absence  of worker consciousness altogether, but the causes of the  unrest was more complicated. In 1917 political issues  gradually came to be perceived through the lens of party  affiliation, but by mid-1918 party consciousness was reversed and a general consciousness of workers' needs restored. By July 1918 the protest movement had lost its momentum in the face of severe repression and was engulfed by the civil war.&quot;</i> In the light of the fate of workers' protest, the May 16th resolution by the Bogatyr' Chemical Plant calling (among other things) for <i>&quot;freedom of  speech and meeting, and an end to the shooting of  citizens and workers&quot;</i> seems to the point. Unsurprisingly, <i>&quot;[f]aced with political opposition within the soviets and worker dissatisfaction in the factories Bolshevik  power increasingly came to reply on the party apparatus itself.&quot;</i> [Richard Sakwa, <i>&quot;The Commune State in Moscow in  1918,&quot;</i> pp. 429-449, <b>Slavic Review</b>, vol. 46, no. 3/4,  p. 442-3, p. 442 and p. 443]</p>
<p>Repression occurred elsewhere: <i>&quot;In June 1918 workers in Tula protested a cut in rations by boycotting the local soviet. The regime declared martial law and arrested the protestors. Strikes followed and were suppressed by violence. In Sormovo, when a Menshevik-Social Revolutionary newspaper was closed, 5,000 workers went on strike. Again firearms were used to break the strike.&quot;</i> Other techniques  were used to break resistance. For example, the regime often threatened rebellious factories with a lock out, which involved numerous layouts, new rules of discipline, purges of workers' organisations and the introduction of piece work. [Thomas F. Remington, <b>Building Socialism in  Bolshevik Russia</b>, p. 105 and p. 107]</p>
<p>Rather than the Civil War disrupting the relationship between  the vanguard party and the class it claimed to lead, it was  in fact the Bolsheviks who did so in face of rising working  class dissent and disillusionment in the spring of 1918. In  fact, <i>&quot;after the initial weeks of 'triumph' . . . Bolshevik  labour relations after October&quot;</i> changed and <i>&quot;soon lead to  open conflict, repression, and the consolidation of Bolshevik  dictatorship over the proletariat in place of proletarian  dictatorship itself.&quot;</i> [Rosenberg, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 117]</p>
<p>Given this, the outbreak of the civil war consolidated workers support for the Bolsheviks and saved it from even more  damaging workers' unrest. As Thomas F. Remington puts it:</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>&quot;At various times groups of workers rebelled against Bolshevik  rule But for the most part, forced to choose between 'their' regime and the unknown horrors of a White dictatorship,  most willingly defended the Bolshevik cause. The effect of this dilemma may be seen in the periodic swings in the workers' political temper. When Soviet rule stood in peril, the war simulated a spirit of solidarity and spared the  regime the defection of its proletarian base. During lulls in the fighting, strikes and demonstrations broke out.&quot;</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 101]  </p></blockquote>
<p>Which, as we will discuss, explains the increased repression in 1921 and onwards. Without the Whites, the Bolsheviks had to enforce their rule directly onto workers who did not want it. Ironically, the Whites <b>helped</b> the Bolsheviks remain in  power. Without the start of the civil war, labour protest would have either ended Bolshevik rule or exposed it as a  dictatorial regime.</p>
<p>This process of workers protest and state repression continued  in 1919 and subsequent years. It followed a cyclical pattern. There was a <i>&quot;new outbreak of strikes in March 1919 after the collapse of Germany and the Bolshevik re-conquest of the Ukraine. The pattern of repression was also repeated. A strike at a galosh factory in early 1919 was followed by the closing of the factory, the firing of a number of workers, and the supervised re-election of its factory committee. The Soviet garrison at Astrakhan mutinied after its bread ration was cut. A strike among the city's workers followed in support. A meeting of 10,000 Astrakhan workers was suddenly surrounded by loyal troops, who fired on the crowd with machine guns and hand grenades, killing 2,000. Another 2,000, taken prisoner, were subsequently executed. In Tula, when strikes at the defence factories stopped production for five days, the government responded by distributing more grain and arresting the strike organisers . . . strikes at Putilov again broke out, at first related to the food crisis . . . The government treated the strike as an act of counter-revolution and responded with a substantial political purge and re-organisation. An official investigation . . . concluded that many shop committees were led by [Left] Social Revolutionaries . . . These committees  were abolished and management representatives were appointed  in their stead.&quot;</i> [Remington, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, pp. 109-10]</p>
<p>The strikes in Petrograd centred around the Putilov shows the response of the authorities to the <i>&quot;atomised&quot;</i> workers who were taking collective action. <i>&quot;In March fifteen factories struck together (roughly 35,000 workers were involved) . . .  workers at Putilov assembled and sent a delegation to the works committee . .  .and put forward a number of demands . . . On 12 March Putilov stopped work. Its workers called to others to join them, and some of them came out in a demonstration where they were fired upon by Cheka troops. Strikes then broke out at fourteen other enterprises . . . On Sunday 16 March an appeal was made to the Putilovtsy to return to normal working the following day or . . .  the sailors and soldiers would be brought in. After a poor showing on the Monday, the sailor went in, and  120 workers were arrested; the sailors remained until the 21st and by the 22nd normal work had been resumed.&quot;</i> In July strikes broke out again in response to the cancellation of holidays which involved 25,000 workers in 31 strikes.  [Mary McAuley, <b>Bread and Justice</b>, pp. 251-253 and p. 254]</p>
<p>In the Moscow area, while it is <i>&quot;impossible to say what proportion  of workers were involved in the various disturbances,&quot;</i> following  the lull after the defeat of the workers' conference movement in  mid-1918 <i>&quot;each wave of unrest was more powerful than the last,  culminating in the mass movement from late 1920.&quot;</i> For example,  at the end of June 1919, <i>&quot;a Moscow committee of defence (KOM)  was formed to deal with the rising tide of disturbances . . .  KOM concentrated emergency power in its hands, overriding the  Moscow Soviet, and demanding obedience from the population. The  disturbances died down under the pressure of repression.&quot;</i>  [Richard Sakwa, <b>Soviet Communists in Power</b>, p. 94 and pp. 94-5]</p>
<p>Vladimir Brovkin summarises the data he provides in his essay <i>&quot;Workers' Unrest and the Bolshevik Response in 1919&quot;</i> (reproduced along with data from other years in his book  <b>Behind the Front Lines of the Civil War</b>) as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>&quot;Data on one strike in one city may be dismissed as incidental. When, however, evidence is available from various sources on simultaneous independent strikes in different cities and overall picture begins to emerge . . . Workers' unrest took  place in Russia's biggest and most important industrial  centres: Moscow, Petrograd, Tver', Tula, Briansk, and Sormovo.  Strikes affected the largest industries . . . Workers'  demands reflected their grievances . .  . The greatest  diversity was in workers' explicitly political demands or  expression of political opinion . . . all workers' resolutions demanded free and fair elections to the soviets . . . some workers . . . demanded the Constituent Assembly . . .  </i></p>
<p><i>&quot;The strikes of 1919 . . . fill an important gap in the  development of the popular movement between October 1917 and February 1921. On the one hand, they should be seen as antecedents of similar strikes in February 1921, which  forced the Communists to abandon war communism. In the  capitals, workers, just as the Kronstadt sailors had, still wanted fairly elected soviets and not a party dictatorship. On the other hand, the strikes continued the protests that had began in the summer of 1918. The variety of behavioural patterns displayed during the  strikes points to a profound continuity. . . </i></p>
<p><i>&quot;In all known cases the Bolsheviks' initial response to strikes was to ban public meetings and rallies . . . In several cities . . . the authorities confiscated strikers' food rations in order to suppress the strike. In at least five cities . . . the Bolsheviks occupied the striking plant and dismissed the strikers en masse . . . In all  known cases the Bolsheviks arrested strikers . . . In  Petrograd, Briansk, and Astrakhan' the Bolsheviks executed striking workers.&quot;</i> [<b>Slavic Review</b>, vol. 49, no. 3, pp. 370-2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nor was this collective struggle stop in 1919 -- <i>&quot;strike action  remained endemic in the first nine months of 1920&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;in the  first six months of 1920 strikes had occurred in seventy-seven  per cent of middle-sized and large works.&quot;</i> For the Petrograd  province, soviet figures state that in 1919 there were 52 strikes  with 65,625 participants and in 1920 73 strikes with 85,645, both  high figures as according to one set of figures, which are by no  means the lowest, there were 109,100 workers there. <i>&quot;Strikes  in 1920,&quot;</i> recounts Aves, <i>&quot;were frequently a direct protest  against the intensification of War Communist labour policies,  the militarisation of labour, the implementation of one-man  management and the struggle against absenteeism, as well as  food supply difficulties. The Communist Party press carried  numerous articles attacking the slogan of 'free labour.'&quot;</i>  [J. Aves, <b>Workers Against Lenin</b>, p. 69 and p. 74]</p>
<p>The spring of 1920 <i>&quot;saw discontent on the railways all over  the country.&quot;</i> This continued throughout the year. For example,  the Aleksansrovskii locomotive works at the end of August,  workers sent three representatives to the works commissar  who had them arrested. Three days later, the workers stopped  work and demanded their release. The authorities locked the  workers out of the works and a guard of 70 sailors were placed  outside the enterprise. The Cheka arrested the workers' soviet  delegates (who were from the SR (Minority) list) as well as  thirty workers. <i>&quot;The opportunity was taken to carry out a  general round-up&quot;</i> and arrests were made at other works.  After the arrests, <i>&quot;a meeting was held to elect new soviet  delegates but the workers refused to co-operate and a  further 150 were arrested and exiled to Murmansk or  transferred to other workshops.&quot;</i> [Aves, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 44  and pp. 46-7]</p>
<p>Strikes occurred in other places, such as Tula were the workforce <i>&quot;contained a high proportion of skilled,  long-standing, hereditary workers.&quot;</i> The <i>&quot;all-out strike&quot;</i>  started at the start of June and on 8 June the local newspaper published a declaration from the Tula soviet threatening the strikers with <i>&quot;the most repressive measures, including the application of the highest measure of punishment&quot;</i> (i.e. executions). The following day the  city was declared to be under a <i>&quot;state of siege&quot;</i> by the local military authorities. The strikers lost ration cards and by 11 June there had been a return to work. Twenty-three workers were sentenced to a forced labour camp until the end of the war. However, the <i>&quot;combined impact of these measures did not prevent further unrest and the workers put forward new demands.&quot;</i> On 19 June, the soviet approved <i>&quot;a programme for the suppression of counter-revolution&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;the transfer of Tula to the position of an armed  camp.&quot;</i> The Tula strike <i>&quot;highlights the way in which workers, particularly skilled workers who were products of  long-standing shop-floor subcultures and hierarchies, retained the capability as well as the will to defend their interests.&quot;</i> [Aves, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 50-55]</p>
<p>While strike activity <i>&quot;was most common in Petrograd, where there had been 2.5 strikers for every workman,&quot;</i> the figure for Moscow was 1.75 and 1.5 in Kazan. In early March <i>&quot;a wave of strikes hit the Volga town of Samara&quot;</i> when a strike by printers in spread to other enterprises. <i>&quot;Strike action in Moscow did not just include traditionally militant male metal workers.&quot;</i> Textile workers, tram workers and printers all took strike action. [Aves, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 69, p. 72 and  pp. 77-8]</p>
<p>Thus strike action was a constant feature of civil war Bolshevik Russia. Rather than being an <i>&quot;atomised&quot;</i> mass, the workers repeatedly organised themselves, made their demands and took collective action to achieve them. In response, the Bolshevik regime used state repression to break this collective activity. As such, <b>if</b> the rise of Stalinism can, as modern-day Leninists argue, be  explained by the <i>&quot;atomisation&quot;</i> of the working class during the civil war then the Bolshevik regime and its repression should be credited with ensuring this happened.</p>
<p>The end of the civil war did not see the end of working  class protest. Quite the reverse. In February and March 1921  <i>&quot;industrial unrest broke out in a nation-wide wave of  discontent . . . General strikes, or very widespread  unrest, hit Petrograd, Moscow, Saratov and Ekaterinoslavl.&quot;</i>  Only one major industrial region was unaffected. As noted above, the Bolsheviks refused to call this movement a  strike wave, preferring the term <b>volynka</b> (which means &quot;go-slow&quot;), yet <i>&quot;the continued use of the term can be justified not to hide its significance but to show that workers' protest consisted not just of strikes but also  of factory occupations, 'Italian strikes,' demonstrations, mass meetings, the beating up of communists and so on.&quot;</i> [Aves, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 109 and p. 112]</p>
<p>In Petrograd in the beginning of February <i>&quot;strikes were becoming an everyday occurrence&quot;</i> and by <i>&quot;the third week of February the situation rapidly deteriorated.&quot;</i> The city was rocked by strikes, meetings and demonstrations. In  response to the general strike the Bolsheviks replied  with a <i>&quot;military clamp-down, mass arrests and other coercive  measures, such as the closure of enterprises, the purging of  the workforce and stopping of rations which accompanied  them.&quot;</i> As we discuss in <a href="append42.html">&quot;What was the Kronstadt Rebellion?&quot;</a>,  these strikes produced the Kronstadt revolt (and, as noted in  <a href="append42.html#app10">section 10</a> of that appendix, the Bolshevik repression ensured the Petrograd workers did not act with the sailors). [Aves, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 113, p. 120]</p>
<p>A similar process of workers revolt and state repression  occurred in Moscow at the same time. There <i>&quot;industrial unrest&quot;</i> also <i>&quot;turned into open confrontation and protest spilled on to the streets.&quot;</i> Meetings were held, followed by demonstrations and strikes. Over the next few days  strikes spread to other districts. Workers demanded now elections to the soviets be held. Striking railway workers sent emissaries along the railway to spread the strike and strikes spread to outside Moscow city itself and into the surrounding provinces. Unsurprisingly, Moscow and Moscow province were put under martial law and SR and menshevik leaders were arrested. [Aves, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 130 pp. 139-144] However, <i>&quot;military units called in&quot;</i> against  striking workers <i>&quot;refused to open fire, and they were  replaced by the armed communist detachments&quot;</i> who did.  <i>&quot;The following day several factories went on strike&quot;</i>  and troops <i>&quot;disarmed and locked in as a precaution&quot;</i> by  the government against possible fraternising. On February  23rd, <i>&quot;Moscow was placed under martial law with a 24-hour  watch on factories by the communist detachments and  trustworthy army units.&quot;</i> [Richard Sakwa, <b>Soviet  Communists in Power</b>, p. 94 and pp. 94-5 and p. 245] The  mixture of (economic) concessions and coercion broke the will of the strikers.</p>
<p>Strikes and protests occurred all across Russia at this time (see Aves, <b>Op. Cit.</b>). In Saratov, the strike started on March 3 when railroad shop workers did not return to their benches and instead rallied to discuss an anticipated further reduction in food rations. <i>&quot;Led by a former  Communist, the railroad workers debated resolutions recently carried by the Moscow proletariat . . . The next day the strike spread to the metallurgical plants and to most other large factories, as Saratov workers elected representatives to an independent commission charged with evaluating the functioning of all economic organs. When it convened, the body called for the re-election of the soviets and immediate release of political prisoners.&quot;</i> The ration cut <i>&quot;represent[ed] the catalyst, but not the cause, of the labour unrest.&quot;</i>  While <i>&quot;the turmoil touched all strata of the proletariat, male and female alike, the initiative for the disturbances came from the skilled stratum that the Communists normally deemed the most conscious.&quot;</i> The Communists shut down the commission and they <i>&quot;expected workers to protest the dissolution of their elected representatives&quot;</i> and so they <i>&quot;set up a Provincial Revolutionary Committee . . . which introduced martial law both in the city and the garrison. It arrested the ringleaders of the workers' movement . . . the police crackdown depressed the workers' movement and the activities of the rival socialist parties.&quot;</i> The Cheka sentenced 219 people to death. [Donald J. Raleigh, <b>Experiencing Russia's Civil War</b>, p. 379, p. 387, p. 388,  pp. 388-9]</p>
<p>A similar <i>&quot;little Kronstadt&quot;</i> broke out in the Ukrainian town of Ekaterinoslavl at the end of May. The workers there <i>&quot;clearly had strong traditions of organisation&quot;</i> and elected a strike committee of fifteen which <i>&quot;put out a series of political ultimatums that were very similar in content to the demands of the Kronstadt rebels.&quot;</i> On 1 June, <i>&quot;by a  pre-arranged signal&quot;</i> workers went on strike throughout the town, with workers joining a meeting of the railway workers. The local Communist Party leader was instructed <i>&quot;to put  down the rebellion without mercy . . . Use Budennyi's  cavalry.&quot;</i> The strikers prepared a train and its driver instructed to spread the strike throughout the network. Telegraph operators were told to send messages throughout the Soviet Republic calling for <i>&quot;free soviets&quot;</i> and soon an area up to fifty miles around the town was affected. The Communists used the Cheka to crush the movement, carrying out mass arrests and shooting 15 workers (and dumping their bodies in the River Dnepr). [Aves, <b>Op. Cit.</b>,  pp. 171-3]</p>
<p>So faced with an <i>&quot;atomised&quot;</i> working class during the period of 1918 and 1921, the Bolsheviks had to respond with martial  law, mass arrests and shootings:</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>&quot;It is not possible to estimate with any degree of accuracy  how many workers were shot by the Cheka during 1918-1921 for  participation in labour protest. However, an examination of individual cases suggests that shootings were employed to inspire terror and were not simply used in the occasional extreme case.&quot;</i> [Aves, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 35]  </p></blockquote>
<p>Post-Kronstadt, similar Bolshevik responses to labour unrest  continued. The economic crisis of 1921 which accompanied the  introduction of the NEP saw unemployment rise yet <i>&quot;[d]espite the heavy toll of redundancies, the ability to organise strikes  did not disappear. Strike statistics for 1921 continue to  provide only a very rough indicator of the true scale of industrial unrest and appear not to include the first half of the year.&quot;</i> The spring of 1922 saw Soviet Russia <i>&quot;hit by a new strike wave&quot;</i> and the strikes <i>&quot;continued to reflect  enterprise traditions.&quot;</i> That year saw 538 strikes with  197,022 participants recorded. [Aves, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 183 and p. 184]</p>
<p>The following year saw more strikes: <i>&quot;In July 1923 more than  100 enterprises employing a total of some 50,000 people were  on strike. In August figures totalled some 140 enterprises  and 80,00 workers. In September and November the strike wave continued unabated.&quot;</i> As in the civil war, the managers  shut down plants, fired the workers and rehired them on an individual basis. In this way, trouble-makers were dismissed and <i>&quot;order&quot;</i> restored. <i>&quot;The pattern of workers' action and Bolshevik reaction played itself out frequently in dozens of other strikes. The Bolsheviks acted with the explicit purpose of rooting out the possibility of further protest. They tried to condition workers that labour protest was futile.&quot;</i> The GPU <i>&quot;used force to disperse workers demonstrating with the arrested strike leaders.&quot;</i> [Vladimir Brovkin, <b>Russia  After Lenin</b>, p. 174, pp. 174-5 and p. 175]</p>
<p>In Moscow, for example, <i>&quot;[b]etween 1921 and 1926, all branches of industry and transport . . . experienced wildcat strikes or other spontaneous labour disturbances. Strike waves peaked in the winter of 1920-21 . . . and in the summer and fall of 1922 and 1923 . . . during July-December 1922, for example, 65 strikes and 209 other industrial disturbances were recorded in Moscow's state enterprises.&quot;</i> Metalworkers were arguably the most active sector at this time while <i>&quot;a number of large strikes&quot;</i> took place in the textile industry (where <i>&quot;strikes were sometimes co-ordinated by spontaneously organised strike committees or 'parallel' factory committees&quot;</i>). And in spite of repression, <i>&quot;politicisation continued to characterise many labour struggles&quot;</i> and, as before, <i>&quot;spontaneous labour activism hindered not only the party's economic program but also the political and social stabilisation of the factories.&quot;</i> [John  B. Hatch, <b>Labour Conflict in Moscow, 1921-1925</b>, p. 62, p. 63,  p. 65, pp. 66-7 and p. 67]</p>
<p>Given this collective rebellion all across the industrial centres  of Russia throughout the Civil War and after, it hard to take  seriously claims that Bolshevik authoritarian was the product of an <i>&quot;atomisation&quot;</i> or <i>&quot;declassing&quot;</i> of the working class or that it had ceased to exist in any meaningful sense. Clearly it  had and was capable of collective action and organisation --  until it was repressed by the Bolsheviks and even then it keep returning. This implies that a key factor in rise of Bolshevik  authoritarian was political -- the simple fact that the workers  would not vote Bolshevik in free soviet and union elections and  so they were not allowed to. As one Soviet Historian put it,  <i>&quot;taking the account of the mood of the workers, the demand for  free elections to the soviets [raised in early 1921] meant the  implementation in practice of the infamous slogan of soviets  without communists,&quot;</i> although there is little evidence that the  strikers actually raised that <i>&quot;infamous&quot;</i> slogan. [quoted by Aves,  <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 123] It should also be noted that Bolshevik orthodoxy  at the time stressed the necessity of Party dictatorship <b>over</b> the workers (see <a href="secH1.html#sech12">section H.1.2</a> for details).</p>
<p>Nor can it be said that this struggle can be blamed on <i>&quot;declassed&quot;</i> elements within the working class itself. In her study of this question, Diane Koenker notes that 90% of the change in the number  of workers in Moscow <i>&quot;is accounted for by men. Working women did not leave the city,&quot;</i> their numbers dropping from 90,000 in 1918 to 80,000 in 1920. Why these 80,000 women workers should be denied a say in their own revolution is not clear, given the arguments of the pro-Bolshevik left. After all, the same workers remained in roughly the same numbers. Looking at the male worker population,  their numbers fell from 215,000 to 124,000 during the same period. However, <i>&quot;the skilled workers whose class consciousness and  revolutionary zeal had helped win the October revolution did not entirely disappear, and the women who remained were likely to  be family members of these veterans of 1917.&quot;</i> It was <i>&quot;the loss of young activists rather than all skilled and class conscious urban workers that caused the level of Bolshevik support to decline during the civil war.&quot;</i> Indeed <i>&quot;the workers who remained in the city were among the most urbanised elements.&quot;</i> In summary, <i>&quot;the deurbanisation of those years represented a change in quantity but not entirely in quality in the cities. The proletariat declined in the city, but it did not wither away . . . a core of the city's working class remained.&quot;</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 440, p. 442,  p. 447 and p. 449]</p>
<p>As Russian anarchist Ida Mett argued decades before in relation  to the strikes in early 1921:</p>
<blockquote><p> <i>&quot;The population was drifting away from the capital. All who had  relatives in the country had rejoined them. The authentic proletariat remained till the end, having the most slender  connections with the countryside. </i></p>
<p><i>&quot;This fact must be emphasised, in order to nail the official lies  seeking to attribute the Petrograd strikes that were soon to break out to peasant elements, 'insufficiently steeled in proletarian  ideas.' The real situation was the very opposite. A few workers were seeking refuge in the countryside. The bulk remained. There  was certainly no exodus of peasants into the starving towns! . . . It was the famous Petrograd proletariat, the proletariat which had  played such a leading role in both previous revolutions, that was  finally to resort to the classical weapon of the class struggle:  the strike.&quot;</i> [<b>The Kronstadt Uprising</b>, p. 36]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In terms of struggle, links between the events in 1917 and those during the civil war also exist. For example Jonathan Aves writes that there were <i>&quot;distinct elements of continuity between the industrial unrest in 1920 and 1917. This is not surprising since the form of industrial unrest in 1920, as in the pre-revolutionary period and in 1917, was closely bound up with enterprise traditions and shop-floor  sub-cultures. The size of the Russian industrial workforce had declined steeply during the Civil War but where enterprises stayed open . . . their traditions of industrial unrest in 1920 shows that such sub-cultures were still capable of  providing the leaders and shared values on which resistance to labour policies based on coercion and Communist Party enthusiasm could be organised. As might be anticipated, the leaders of unrest were often to be found amongst the skilled male workers who enjoyed positions of authority in the informal shop-floor hierarchies.&quot;</i> Moreover, <i>&quot;despite intense repression, small groups of politicised activists were also important in initiating protest and some enterprises developed traditions of opposition to the communists.&quot;</i>  [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 39]</p>
<p>Looking at the strike wave of early 1921 in Petrograd, the  <i>&quot;strongest reason for accepting the idea that it was established  workers who were behind the <b>volynka</b> [i.e. the strike wave] is  the form and course of protest. Traditions of protest reaching  back through the spring of 1918 to 1917 and beyond were an  important factor in the organisation of the <b>volynka.</b> . . .  There was also a degree of organisation . . . which belies the  impression of a spontaneous outburst.&quot;</i> [Aves, <b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 126]</p>
<p>Clearly, then, the idea that the Russian working class was  atomised or declassed cannot be defended given this series of struggles and state repression. In fact, as noted, the notion that the workers were <i>&quot;declassed&quot;</i> was used to justify state  repression of collective working class struggle. <i>&quot;The thought  oppressed me,&quot;</i> wrote Emma Goldman, <i>&quot;that what [the Bolsheviks]  called 'defence of the Revolution' was really only the defence  of [their] party in power.&quot;</i> [<b>My Disillusionment in Russia</b>,  p. 57] She was right -- the class struggle in Bolshevik Russia  did not stop, it continued except the ruling class had changed from bourgeoisie to Bolshevik dictatorship.</p>
<p>Faced with this collective resistance to Bolshevism, the Leninist could argue that while the working class was capable of collective decision making and action, the nature of that action was suspect. This arguments rests on the premise that the <i>&quot;advanced&quot;</i> workers (i.e. party members) left the workplace for the front or for  government posts, leaving the <i>&quot;backward&quot;</i> workers behind. This  argument is often used, particularly in regard to the Kronstadt revolt of 1921 (see <a href="append42.html#app8">section 8</a> of the appendix on <a href="append42.html">&quot;What was the Kronstadt Rebellion?&quot;</a>).</p>
<p>Of course, this argument raises more problems that its solves. In <b>any</b> revolution the <i>&quot;most politically consciousness&quot;</i> tend  to volunteer to go to the front first and, of course, tend to be elected as delegates to committees of various kinds (local,  regional and national). There is little that can be done about it. Needless to say, if <i>&quot;soviet democracy&quot;</i> depends on the <i>&quot;advanced&quot;</i> workers being there in order for it to work, then it suggests that  the commitment to democracy is lacking in those who argue along these lines. It suggests that if the <i>&quot;backward&quot;</i> masses reject  the <i>&quot;advanced&quot;</i> ones then the latter have the right, even the duty, to impose their will on the former. And it also begs the  question of who determines what constitutes <i>&quot;backward&quot;</i> -- if it  means <i>&quot;does not support the party&quot;</i> then it becomes little more  than a rationale for party dictatorship (as it did under Lenin  and Trotsky).</p>
<p>Writing in 1938, Trotsky inadvertently exposes the logic of this position. Asserting that a <i>&quot;revolution is 'made' directly by a <b>minority</b>,&quot;</i> he argued that the <i>&quot;success&quot;</i> of a revolution  is <i>&quot;possible&quot;</i> when <i>&quot;this minority finds more or less support, or  at least friendly neutrality, on the part of the majority.&quot;</i> So what happens if the majority expresses opposition to the party? Unfortunately Trotsky does not raise this question, but he does answer it indirectly. As we discuss in  <a href="append42.html#app15">section 15</a> of the appendix on  <a href="append42.html&quot;">&quot;What was the Kronstadt Rebellion?&quot;</a>, Trotsky argues that <i>&quot;to free the soviets from the leadership [sic!] of  the Bolsheviks would have meant within a short time to demolish  the soviets themselves. The experience of the Russian soviets  during the period of Menshevik and SR domination and, even more  clearly, the experience of the German and Austrian soviets under  the domination of the Social Democrats, proved this. Social  Revolutionary-anarchist soviets could only serve as a bridge  from the proletarian dictatorship. They could play no other role,  regardless of the 'ideas' of their participants.&quot;</i> [Lenin and  Trotsky, <b>Kronstadt</b>, p. 85 and p. 90]</p>
<p>Thus to let the working masses (the <i>&quot;majority&quot;</i>) have free soviet elections and reject the vanguard (the <i>&quot;minority&quot;</i>) would mean the  end of soviet power. Thus allowing the proletariat a say in  progress of the revolution means the end of the <i>&quot;proletarian  dictatorship&quot;</i>! Which, of course, is interesting logic. The authoritarian core of the Bolshevik vision of revolution is thus exposed.</p>
<p>Victor Serge also presents an insight into the Bolshevik  perspective on the revolution. He states that <i>&quot;[a]gitation  conducted by the SRs and Mensheviks called demonstrations  in the streets and prepared for a general strike. The  demands were: free trade, wage increases, payment of wages  one, two or three months in advance and 'democracy.' The  intention was to incite the working class itself against  the revolution.&quot;</i> Which only makes sense once you realise  that by <i>&quot;the revolution&quot;</i> Serge simply meant <i>&quot;the Bolsheviks&quot;</i>  and the obvious truth that the working class was <b>not</b>  managing the revolution at all, was <b>not,</b> in any sense,  &quot;in power.&quot; <i>&quot;The best elements among the workers,&quot;</i> explains  Serge, <i>&quot;were away fighting; those in the factories were  precisely the less energetic, less revolutionary sections,  along with the petty folk, yesterday's small shopkeepers  and artisans, who had come there to find refuge. This  proletariat of the reserve often allowed itself to fall  under the sway of Menshevik propaganda.&quot;</i> [<b>Year One of the  Russian Revolution</b>, p. 229]</p>
<p>Given that Serge is discussing the period <b>before</b> the Czechoslovak revolt, a greater indictment of Bolshevism cannot be found. After all, what does <i>&quot;workers' democracy&quot;</i>  mean unless the proletariat can vote for its own delegates? Little wonder Daniel Guerin described Serge's book as  <i>&quot;largely a justification of the liquidation of the soviets  by Bolshevism.&quot;</i> [<b>Anarchism</b>, p. 97] After all, what point  is there having genuine soviet elections if the <i>&quot;less  revolutionary sections&quot;</i> (i.e. Trotsky's <i>&quot;majority&quot;</i>) will  not vote for the vanguard? And can socialism exist without  democracy? Can we expect an unaccountable vanguard to  govern in the interests of anyone but its own? Of course  not!</p>
<p>Thus the Bolsheviks did not solve the answer the questions  Malatesta raised in 1891, namely <i>&quot;if you consider these  worthy electors as unable to look after their own interests  themselves, how is it that they will know how to choose for  themselves the shepherds who must guide them? And how will  they be able to solve this problem of social alchemy, of producing the election of a genius from the votes of a  mass of fools?&quot;</i> [<b>Anarchy</b>, p. 53]</p>
<p>Given this, is it surprising that the Bolsheviks revised  the Marxist theory of the state to justify elite rule? As  discussed in  <a href="secH3.html#sech38">section H.3.8</a>, once in power Lenin and Trotsky stressed that the &quot;workers' state&quot; had to be independent of the working class in order to overcome the <i>&quot;wavering&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;vacillation of the masses themselves.&quot;</i> Or, to quote Serge, the <i>&quot;party of the proletariat must know, at hours of decision,  how to break the resistance of the backward elements among the  masses; it must know how to stand firm sometimes against the  masses . . . it must know how to go against the current, and  cause proletarian consciousness to prevail against lack of consciousness and against alien class influences.&quot;</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>,  p. 218] Of course, by definition, <b>every</b> group is <i>&quot;backward&quot;</i>  compared to the vanguard and so Serge's argument amounts to  little more than a justification for party dictatorship  <b>over</b> the proletariat.</p>
<p>The reason why such a system would not result in socialism does  not take long to discover. For anarchists, freedom is not just  a goal, a noble end to be achieved, but rather a necessary  part of the process of creating socialism. Eliminate freedom  (and, as a necessary result, workplace and community  self-management) and the end result will be anything <b>but</b>  socialism. Ultimately, as Malatesta argued, <i>&quot;the only way that  the masses can raise themselves&quot;</i> is by freedom <i>&quot;for it is only  through freedom that one educates oneself to be free.&quot;</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>,  p. 52] Ironically, by using state repression to combat <i>&quot;backward&quot;</i> elements, the Bolsheviks ensured that they stayed that way and, more importantly, disempowered the <b>whole</b> working class so ensuring that Bolshevik dictatorship came into constant conflict with it and its continuing struggle for autonomy. Rather than base itself on the creative powers of the masses, Bolshevism  crushed it as a threat to its power and so ensured that the economic and social problems affecting Russia increased.</p>
<p>And need it be pointed out that <i>&quot;low&quot;</i> culture and/or <i>&quot;backward&quot;</i>  social life have been used by numerous imperialist and authoritarian states to justify their rule over a given population? It matters  little whether the population are of the same nationality of the rulers or from a subjugated people, the arguments and the logic are the same. Whether dressed up in racist or classist clothing, the  same elitist pedigree lies behind the pro-Bolshevik argument that democracy would have brought <i>&quot;chaos&quot;</i> or <i>&quot;capitalist restoration.&quot;</i>  The implicit assumption that working class people are not fit for  self-government is clear from these rationales. Equally obvious is the idea that the party knows better than working class people what is best for them.</p>
<p>Sounding like Bolshevik Henry Kissingers, the Leninists argue that Lenin and Trotsky had to enforce their dictatorship <b>over</b> the  proletariat to stop a <i>&quot;capitalist restoration&quot;</i> (Kissinger was the  US state's liaison with the Chilean military when it helped their  coup in 1973 and infamously stated that the country should not be  allowed to turn communist due to the stupidity of its own people).  Needless to say, anarchists argue that even if the Bolshevik  regime had not already need capitalist (specifically, <b>state</b>  capitalist) this logic simply represents an elitist position based on <i>&quot;socialism from above.&quot;</i> Yes, soviet democracy <b>may</b> have resulted in the return of (private) capitalism but by maintaining  party dictatorship the possibility of socialism was automatically  nullified. Simply put, the pro-Leninist argument implies that  socialism can be implemented from above as long as the right  people are in power. The authoritarian core of Leninism is  exposed by these arguments and the repression of working class  revolt which they justified.</p>
<p>Given this, it seems incredulous for Leninists like Chris Harman to argue that it was the <i>&quot;decimation of the working class&quot;</i> which caused (by <i>&quot;necessity&quot;</i>) the <i>&quot;Soviet institutions&quot;</i> to take <i>&quot;on a  life independently of the class they had arisen from. Those workers  and peasants who fought the Civil War could not govern themselves  collectively from their places in the factories.&quot;</i> [<b>How the  revolution was lost</b>] Given that this <i>&quot;independent&quot;</i> life is required to allow the party to <i>&quot;go against the current,&quot;</i> Harman simply fails to understand the dynamics of the revolution, the position of the vanguard and the resistance of the working class subject to it. Moreover, the reason <b>why</b> the <i>&quot;workers and peasants&quot;</i> could not govern themselves collectively was because the party had seized power for itself and systematically destroyed soviet, workplace and military democracy to remain there. Then there is  the way the Bolsheviks reacted to such collective unrest. Simply  put, they sought to break the workers as a collective force. The  use of lockouts, re-registration was typical, as was the arresting  of <i>&quot;ringleaders.&quot;</i> It seems ironic, therefore, to blame <i>&quot;objective factors&quot;</i> for the <i>&quot;atomisation&quot;</i> of the working class when, in fact, this was a key aim of Bolshevik repression of labour protest.</p>
<p>Little wonder, then, that the role of the masses in the Russian  Revolution after October 1917 is rarely discussed by pro-Bolshevik  writers. Indeed, the conclusion to be reached is simply that their  role is to support the party, get it into power and then do what  it tells them. Unfortunately for the Bolsheviks, the Russian  working class refused to do this. Instead they practised collective struggle in defence of their economic <b>and</b> political interests, struggle which inevitably brought them into conflict both with the &quot;workers' state&quot; and their role in Bolshevik ideology. Faced with this collective action, the Bolshevik leaders (starting with Lenin) started to talk about the <i>&quot;declassing&quot;</i> of the proletariat to justify their repression of (and power <b>over</b>) the working class. Ironically, it was the aim of Bolshevik repression to <i>&quot;atomise&quot;</i> the working class as, fundamentally, their rule depended on it. While Bolshevik repression did, in the end, win out it cannot be said that the working class in Russia did not resist the usurpation of power by the Bolshevik party. As such, rather than <i>&quot;atomisation&quot;</i> or <i>&quot;declassing&quot;</i> being the cause for Bolshevik power and repression, it was, in fact, one of <b>results</b> of them.</p>

<h2><a name="app6">6 Did the Bolsheviks blame <i>&quot;objective factors&quot;</i> for their actions?</a></h2>
<p>In a word, no. At the time of the revolution and for some period afterwards, the idea that <i>&quot;objective factors&quot;</i> were responsible for their policies was one which few, if any, Bolshevik leaders  expressed. As we discussed in <a href="append43.html#app2">section 2</a>, Bolsheviks like  Lenin, Trotsky and Bukharin argued that <b>any</b> revolution would face civil war and economic crisis. Lenin <b>did</b> talk about the <i>&quot;declassing&quot;</i> of the proletariat from 1920 onwards, but that did  not seem to affect the proletarian and socialist character of his  regime (as we noted in <a href="append43.html#app5">section 5</a>, Lenin's argument was developed in the context of <b>increasing</b> working class collective action, <b>not</b> its absence).</p>
<p>This is not to say that the Bolshevik leaders were 100% happy with the state of their revolution. Lenin, for example, expressed concern about the rising bureaucratic deformations he saw in the soviet state (particularly after the end of the civil war). Yet Lenin, while  concerned about the bureaucracy, was not concerned about the Party's  monopoly of power. Unsurprisingly, he fought the bureaucracy by  &quot;top-down&quot; and, ironically, bureaucratic methods, the only ones left  to him. A similar position was held by Trotsky, who was quite explicit  in supporting the party dictatorship throughout the 1920s (and, indeed, the 1930s). Needless to say, both failed to understand how bureaucracy  arises and how it could be effectively fought.</p>
<p>This position started to change, however, as the 1920s drew on and Trotsky was increasingly sidelined from power. Then, faced with the  rise of Stalinism, Trotsky had to find a theory which allowed him  to explain the degeneration of the revolution and, at the same time,  absolve Bolshevik ideology (and his own actions and ideas!) from  all responsibility for it. He did so by invoking the objective factors facing the revolution. Since then, his various followers have utilised this argument, with various changes in emphasis, to  attack Stalinism while defending Bolshevism.</p>
<p>The problem with this type of argument is that all the major evils usually associated with Stalinism already existed under Lenin and Trotsky. Party dictatorship, one-man management, repression of  opposition groups and working class protest, state bureaucracy  and so on all existed before Stalin manoeuvred himself into  absolute power. And with the exception of state bureaucracy, none of the mainstream Bolshevik leaders found anything to complain  about. Indeed, the reverse. Whether it is Lenin or Trotsky, the  sad fact of the matter is that a party dictatorship presiding  over an essentially state capitalism economy was not considered a bad thing. Which, of course, causes problems for those who  seek to distance Lenin and Trotsky from Stalinism and claim that Bolshevism is fundamentally <i>&quot;democratic&quot;</i> in nature.</p>
<p>The knots Leninists get into to do this can be ludicrous. A particularly crazy example of this can be seen from the UK's Socialist Workers' Party. For John Rees, it is a truism that  <i>&quot;it was overwhelmingly the force of circumstance which obliged  the Bolsheviks to retreat so far from their own goals. They  travelled this route in opposition to their own theory, not  because of it -- no matter what rhetorical justifications were  given at the time.&quot;</i> [<i>&quot;In Defence of October,&quot;</i> pp. 3-82,  <b>International Socialism</b>, no. 52, p. 70]</p>
<p>However, this sort of position has little substance to it. It is both logically and factually flawed. Logically, it simply makes little sense as anything but an attempt to narrow political discussion and whitewash Bolshevik practice and politics. Rees, in effect, is saying that not only are  we <b>not</b> to judge the Bolsheviks by their actions, we must  also discount what they said -- unless it was something modern  day Leninists approve of! Given that Leninists constantly quote from Lenin's (and Trotsky's) post-1918 works, it seems strange that they try to stop others so doing! Strange, but not surprising, given their task is to perpetuate the Bolshevik Myth. Where that leaves revolutionary politics is left unsaid, but it seems to involve worshipping at the shrine of October and treating as a heretic anyone who dares suggest we analysis it in any depth and perhaps learn lessons from it and the Bolshevism that dominated it.</p>
<p>Of course Rees' comments are little more than assertions. Given that he dismisses the idea that we can actually take what any Bolshevik says at face value, we are left with little more than a mind reading operation in trying to find out what the likes of Lenin and Trotsky <i>&quot;really&quot;</i> thought. Perhaps the root explanation of Rees' position is the awkward fact that there are no quotes from any of the leading Bolsheviks which support it? After all, if they were quotes from the hallowed texts expounding the position Rees says the Bolshevik leaders <i>&quot;really&quot;</i> held then he would have provided them. The simple fact is that Lenin and Trotsky, like  all the Bolshevik leaders, considered a one-party dictatorship  ruling over a state capitalist economy as some form of <i>&quot;socialism.&quot;</i> That was certainly Trotsky's position and he was <b>not</b> shy in  expressing. But, of course, we can dismiss this simply as  <i>&quot;rhetorical justifications&quot;</i> rather than an expression of <i>&quot;their own theory&quot;</i>! We will never know, as they never expressed <i>&quot;their own theory&quot;</i> and instead made do with the <i>&quot;rhetorical  justifications&quot;</i> Rees is at such pains for us to ignore!</p>
<p>Which shows that a major problem in discussing the failure of the Russian Revolution is the attitude of modern day Leninists. Rees presents us with another example when he asserts that <i>&quot;what is  required of historians, particularly Marxists, is to separate  phrase from substance.&quot;</i> The Bolsheviks, Rees argues, were <i>&quot;inclined to make a virtue of necessity, to claim that the harsh measures of the civil war were the epitome of socialism.&quot;</i> Thus the Bolsheviks cannot be blamed either for what they did or what they said. Indeed, he states that non-Leninists <i>&quot;take Lenin or Trotsky's shouts of command in the midst of battle and portray them as  considered analyses of events.&quot;</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. 46]</p>
<p>This argument is simply incredulous. After all, neither Lenin nor Trotsky could be said to be anything <b>but</b> political activists  who took the time to consider events and analyse them in detail.  Moreover, they defended their arguments in terms of Marxism. Would Rees consider Lenin's <b>State and Revolution</b> as an unimportant work? After all, this was produced in the midst of the events of 1917, in often difficult circumstances. If so, then why not his other, less appealing, political proclamations (never mind actions)? Moreover,  looking at some of the works produced in this period it is clear  that they are anything <b>but</b> <i>&quot;shouts of command in the midst of battle.&quot;</i> Trotsky's <b>Terrorism and Communism</b> is a substantial book,  for example It was not an ad hoc comment made during a conference  or <i>&quot;in the midst of battle.&quot;</i> Quite the reverse, it was a detailed, substantial and thought-out reply to the criticism by the influential German social democrat Karl Kaustky (and, before Lenin, the most  internationally respected Marxist thinker). Indeed, Trotsky  explicitly asks the question <i>&quot;[i]s there still theoretical  necessity to justify revolutionary terrorism?&quot;</i> and answers yes,  his <i>&quot;book must serve the ends of an irreconcilable struggle against  the cowardice, half-measures, and hypocrisy of Kautskianism in all  countries.&quot;</i> [<b>Terrorism and Communism</b>, p. 9 and p. 10]</p>
<p>Therefore, on the face of it, Rees's comments are hard to take seriously. It is even harder to take when it becomes clear that Rees does not apply his comments consistently or logically. He does not object to quoting Lenin and Trotsky during this period when they say something he <b>approves</b> of, regardless of how well it fits into their actions. It would be no exaggeration to say that his <i>&quot;argument&quot;</i> is simply an attempt to narrow the area of debate, marking off limits any comments by his heroes which would place his ideology in a bad light. It is hardly convincing,  particularly when their <i>&quot;good&quot;</i> quotes are so at odds with their practice and their <i>&quot;bad&quot;</i> quotes so in line with them. And as Marx argued, we should judge people by what they do, <b>not</b> by what they say. This seems a basic principle of scientific  analysis and it is significant, if not surprising, that Leninists like Rees want to reject it.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the theoretical problem with this position is that it denies the importance of implementing ideas. After all, even if it where true that the <i>&quot;theory&quot;</i> of Bolshevism was different to its practice and the justifications for that practice, it would leave us with the conclusion that this <i>&quot;theory&quot;</i> was not sufficient when faced with the rigours of reality. In other words, that it is impractical. A conclusion that Leninists do not want to draw, hence the stress on <i>&quot;objective factors&quot;</i> to explain the failure of Bolshevism. As Marx said, judge people  by what they do, not what they say (unless, of course, as with the Bolsheviks post-October, what they said reflects what they  did!)</p>
<p>Similarly, there seems to be an idealist tint to Leninist  accounts of the Russian Revolution. After all, they seem to think that the Lenin of 1921 was, essentially, the same person as the Lenin of 1917! That seems to violate the basic ideas of materialism. As Herbert Read points out, <i>&quot;the phrase 'the  dictatorship of the proletariat' . . . became fatal through the  interventions of two political expedients -- the identification  of the proletariat with the Bolshevik Party, and the use of the  State as an instrument of revolution. Expedients and compromises may have been necessary for the defeat of the reactionary  forces; but there is no doubt whatsoever that what took place was a progressive brutalisation of Lenin's own mind under the corrupting influence of the exercise of power.&quot;</i> [<b>A One-Man Manifesto</b>, p. 51] It seems common sense that if a political  strategy exposes its followers to the corrupting effects of  power we should factor this into any evaluation of it. Sadly, Leninists fail to do this -- even worse, they attempt to  whitewash the post-October Lenin (and Trotsky) by excluding the &quot;bad&quot; quotes which reflect their practice, a practice  which they are at pains to downplay (or ignore)!</p>
<p>Then, of course, there is the attitude of the Bolshevik leaders  themselves to these so-called <i>&quot;shouts of command in the midst of battle.&quot;</i> Rather than dismiss them as irrelevant, they continued to subscribe to them years later. For example, Trotsky was still in favour of party dictatorship in the late 1930s (see  <a href="secH1.html#sech12">section H.1.2</a>). Looking at his justly infamous <b>Terrorism and Communism</b>, we discover Trotsky in the 1930s reiterating his support for his  arguments of 1920. His preface to the 1936 French edition sees  him state that it was <i>&quot;devoted to a clarification of the methods  of the proletariat's revolutionary policy in our epoch.&quot;</i> He  concluded as follows: <i>&quot;Victory is conceivable only on the  basis of Bolshevik methods, to the defence of which the present  work is devoted.&quot;</i> The previous year, in his introduction to  the second English edition, he was equally unrepentant. <i>&quot;The British proletariat,&quot;</i> he argued, <i>&quot;will enter upon a period of  political crisis and theoretical criticism . . . The teachings of Marx and Lenin for the first time will find the masses as  their audience. Such being the case, it may be also that the present book will turn out to be not without its use.&quot;</i> He  dismissed the <i>&quot;consoling illusion&quot;</i> that <i>&quot;the arguments of this book [were] true for backward Russia&quot;</i> but <i>&quot;utterly without application to advanced lands.&quot;</i> The <i>&quot;wave of Fascist or  militarised police dictatorships&quot;</i> in the 1920s and 1930s was  the reason. It seems ironic that Trotsky's self-proclaimed  followers are now repeating the arguments of what he termed  &quot;incurable Fabians.&quot; [<b>Terrorism and Communism</b>, p. xix,  p. xxxv, p. xlvii and p. xxxix]</p>
<p>Rather than distance himself from the authoritarian and state  capitalist policies modern day Leninists claim were thrust upon an unwilling Bolshevik party by <i>&quot;objective factors,&quot;</i> Trotsky  defends them! Moreover, as we noted in  <a href="append42.html#app12">section 12</a> of the appendix on <a href="append42.html">&quot;What was the Kronstadt Rebellion?&quot;</a>, Trotsky himself argues that these <i>&quot;objective factors&quot;</i> would face <b>every</b> revolution. As it is, he argues that it was only the <i>&quot;slow development of the revolution in the West&quot;</i> which stopped <i>&quot;a  direct passage from military Communism to a Socialistic system of production.&quot;</i> Rather than admit to <i>&quot;illusions&quot;</i> caused by the &quot;iron necessity&quot; of willing the civil war, he talks about <i>&quot;those economic hopes which were bound up with the development of the world revolution.&quot;</i> He even links Bolshevik practice with Stalinism, noting that the <i>&quot;idea of five-year plans was not only formulated  in that period [1918-1920], but in some economic departments it was also technically worked out.&quot;</i> [<b>Op. Cit.</b>, p. xliii]</p>
<p>Even his essay outlining what he considers the differences between Stalinism and Bolshevism does not see him fundamentally distancing himself from the positions modern day Leninists like to explain by &quot;objective factors.&quot; He stated that the <i>&quot;Bolshevik party achieved  in the civil war the correct combination of military art and Marxist  politics.&quot;</i> What did that involve? Immediately before making that claim he argued that the <i>&quot;Bolshevik party has shown the entire world  how to carry out armed insurrection and the seizure of power. Those  who propose the abstraction of the Soviets from the party dictatorship  should understand that only thanks to the party dictatorship were the  Soviets able to lift themselves out of the mud of reformism and attain  the state form of the proletariat.&quot;</i> Thus the <i>&quot;party dictatorship&quot;</i> is  seen as being an example of <i>&quot;Marxist politics&quot;</i> being successfully applied and not something to be opposed. Moreover, <i>&quot;the Bolshevik  party was able to carry on its magnificent 'practical' work only  because it illuminated all its steps with theory.&quot;</i> [<b>Stalinism and  Bolshevism</b>] Clearly, rather than denounce the power of the party as being against Bolshevik theory, as Rees claims, for Trotsky it represented its application. While he excuses some Bolshevik actions (such as the banning of opposition groups) as a product of <i>&quot;objective factors,&quot;</i> he clearly sees the degeneration of the revolution coming  <b>after</b> the civil war and its <i>&quot;correct combination&quot;</i> of <i>&quot;Marxist  politics&quot;</i> and <i>&quot;military art,&quot;</i> which included <i>&quot;party dictatorship&quot;</i> over the soviets.</p>
<p>This lack of distancing is to be expected. After, the idea that &quot;objective factors&quot; caused the degeneration of the Russian  Revolution was first developed by Trotsky to explain, after his fall from power) the rise of Stalinism. While <b>he</b> was head of  the Soviet state no such &quot;objective&quot; factors seemed to be  required to &quot;explain&quot; the party dictatorship over the working  class. Indeed, quite the reverse. As he argued in 1923 <i>&quot;[i]f  there is one question which basically not only does not require  revision but does not so much as admit the thought of revision,  it is the question of the dictatorship of the Party.&quot;</i> [<b>Leon  Trotsky Speaks</b>, p. 158]</p>
<p>Trotsky was just stating mainstream Bolshevik ideology, echoing  a statement made in March 1923 by the Central Committee (of  which he and Lenin were members) to mark the 25th anniversary  of the founding of the Communist Party. It sums up the lessons  gained from the revolution and states that <i>&quot;the party of the  Bolsheviks proved able to stand out fearlessly against the  vacillations within its own class, vacillations which, with  the slightest weakness in the vanguard, could turn into an unprecedented defeat for the proletariat.&quot;</i> Vacillations, of  course, are expressed by workers' democracy. Little wonder the statement rejects it: <i>&quot;The dictatorship of the working class  finds its expression in the dictatorship of the party.&quot;</i> [<i>&quot;To  the Workers of the USSR&quot;</i> in G. Zinoviev, <b>History of the  Bolshevik Party</b>, p. 213, p. 214] It should be noted that Trotsky had made identical comments before and immediately after the civil war -- as well as long after (see  <a href="secH3.html#sech38">section H.3.8</a> for details).</p>
<p>So, as with all the leading Bolsheviks, he considered the party  dictatorship as an inevitable result of any proletarian revolution  Moreover, he did not question the social relationships within  production either. One-man management held no fears for him  and he called the state capitalist regime under himself and  Lenin as <i>&quot;socialist&quot;</i> and defended it as such. He was fully  supportive of one-man management. Writing in 1923, he argued  that the <i>&quot;system of actual one-man management must be applied  in the organisation of industry from top to bottom. For leading  economic organs of industry to really direct industry and to  bear responsibility for its fate, it is essential for them to  have authority over the selection of functionaries and their  transfer and removal.&quot;</i> These economic organs must <i>&quot;in actual  practice have full freedom of selection and appointment.&quot;</i>  [quoted by Robert V. Daniels, <b>A Documentary History of  Communism</b>, vol. 1, p. 237]</p>
<p>All of these post-civil war opinions of course, fit in well with his civil war opinions on the matter. Which, incidentally, explains why, to quote a Leninist, Trotsky <i>&quot;continued to  his death to harbour the illusion that somehow, despite the  lack of workers' democracy, Russia was a 'workers' state.'&quot;</i>  Simply put, there had been no workers' democracy under Lenin and Trotsky and he considered that regime a <i>&quot;workers' state.&quot;</i> The question arises why Harman thinks Lenin's Russia was some kind of &quot;workers' state&quot; if workers' democracy is the criteria by which such things are to be judged. But, then  again, he thinks Trotsky's <b>Left Opposition</b> <i>&quot;framed a policy along [the] lines&quot;</i> of <i>&quot;returning to genuine workers' democracy&quot;</i>! [Chris Harman,<b>Bureaucracy and Revolution in Eastern Europe</b>,  p. 20 and p. 19]</p>
<p>Now, it seems strange that rather than present what he <i>&quot;really&quot;</i>  thought, Trotsky expounded what presumably is the <b>opposite</b> of  it. Surely the simplistic conclusion to draw is that Trotsky said  what he really did think and that this was identical to his  so-called <i>&quot;shouts of command&quot;</i> made during the civil war? But,  of course, all these comments can be dismissed as <i>&quot;rhetorical  justifications&quot;</i> and not reflective of Trotsky's real <i>&quot;theory.&quot;</i> Or can they? Ultimately, either you subscribe to the idea that Lenin and Trotsky were able to express their ideas themselves or you  subscribe to the notion that they hid their <i>&quot;real&quot;</i> politics and only modern-day Leninists can determine what they, in fact, <i>&quot;really&quot;</i> meant to say and what they &quot;really&quot; stood for. And as for all those &quot;awkward&quot; quotes which express the <b>opposite</b> of the divined true faith, well, they can be ignored.</p>
<p>Which is, of course, hardly a convincing position to take.  Particularly as Lenin and Trotsky were hardly shy in justifying  their authoritarian policies and expressing a distinct lack of  concern over the fate of any <b>meaningful</b> working class conquest  of the revolution like, say, soviet democracy. As Samuel Farber  notes that <i>&quot;there is no evidence indicating that Lenin or any of  the mainstream Bolshevik leaders lamented the loss of workers'  control or of democracy in the soviets, or at least referred to  these losses as a retreat, as Lenin declared with the replacement  of War Communism by NEP in 1921.&quot;</i> [<b>Before Stalinism</b>, p. 44]</p>
<p>The sad fact is that the inter-party conflicts of the 1920s  were <b>not</b> about <i>&quot;workers' democracy,&quot;</i> rather party democracy. The Bolsheviks simply relabelled <i>&quot;party democracy&quot;</i> as <i>&quot;workers' democracy.&quot;</i> Little wonder in 1925 that Max Eastman, one of  Trotsky's main supporters at the time, stated <i>&quot;this programme of  democracy within the party [was] called 'Workers' Democracy' by  Lenin&quot;</i> and that <i>&quot;Trotsky merely revived this original plea.&quot;</i>  [<b>Since Lenin Died</b>, p. 35] Trotsky held this position throughout  the 1920s and 1930s. As we noted in  <a href="append42.html#app13">section 13</a> of the appendix on <a href="append42.html">&quot;What was the Kronstadt Rebellion?&quot;</a>, the 1927 <b>Platform of the Opposition</b> restated its belief in party  dictatorship and argued that Stalin was undermining it in  favour of rule by the bureaucracy. Ironically, Trotskyists in soviet prisons in the early 1930s <i>&quot;continued to consider that 'Freedom to choose one's party -- that is Menshevism'&quot;</i> and this was their <i>&quot;final verdict.&quot;</i> [Ante Ciliga, <b>The Russian Enigma</b>, p. 280] No wonder they seemed surprised to be there!</p>
<p>Trotsky's issue with Stalinism was not based on <b>real</b> socialist principles, such as meaningful working class freedoms and power. Rather it was a case of <i>&quot;the political centre of gravity ha[ving] shifted from the proletarian vanguard to the bureaucracy&quot;</i> and this caused <i>&quot;the party&quot;</i> to change <i>&quot;its social structure as  well as in its ideology.&quot;</i> [<b>Stalinism and Bolshevism</b>] The party dictatorship had been replaced by the dictatorship of the state bureaucracy, in other words. Once this happened,  Trotsky sought to explain it. As analysing the impact of  Bolshevik ideology and practice were, by definition, out  of the question, that left the various objective factors  Trotsky turned to to explain developments after 1923. Now the  concern for <i>&quot;objective factors&quot;</i> appeared, to explain Stalinism while keeping true to Bolshevik ideology <b>and</b> practice.</p>
<p>So, in summary, the leading Bolsheviks did not view &quot;objective factors&quot; as explaining the failure of the revolution. Indeed, until Trotsky was squeezed out of power they did not think that the revolution <b>had</b> failed. Party dictatorship and one-man management were <b>not</b> considered as expressions of a failed  revolution, rather a successful one. Trotsky's issue with  Stalinism was simply that the bureaucracy had replaced the <i>&quot;the proletarian vanguard&quot;</i> (i.e. himself and his followers)  as the dominant force in the Soviet State and it had started to use the techniques of political repression developed against opposition parties and groups against him. The idea that  &quot;objective factors&quot; caused the failure of the revolution was  not used until the late 1920s and even then not used to explain the party dictatorship but rather the usurpation of <b>its</b> power by the bureaucracy.</p>
