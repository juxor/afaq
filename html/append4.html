<title>Appendix - The Russian Revolution</title>

<h1><center>Appendix -- The Russian Revolution </center></h1>
<p>This appendix of the FAQ exists to discuss in depth the Russian revolution and the impact that Leninist ideology and practice had on its outcome. Given that the only reason why Leninism is taken seriously in some parts of the revolutionary movement is the  Russian Revolution, it is useful to expose what Alexander Berkman called &quot;the Bolshevik Myth.&quot; This means discussing certain aspects of the revolution and indicating exactly how Leninism helped  destroy any libertarian potential it had. It also means analysing common, modern-day, Leninist excuses for the actions of the  Bolsheviks to see if they hold water. It also means analysing in depth specific events of the revolution (such as the Kronstadt uprising of March 1921 and the libertarian influenced Makhnovist  movement) to see if there was an alternative to Leninism at the time. Luckily, the answer is yes.</p>
<p>As will become clear from this appendix, Bolshevik actions and  ideology had a decisive impact on the development and degeneration of the Revolution. With its centralised, top-down statist political vision, its (openly) state capitalist economic vision and its aim for party power, Leninism had pushed the revolution in an  authoritarian direction before the Russian Civil War started (the most common Leninist explanation of what went wrong). Leninism, ironically enough, proved the anarchist critique of Marxism to be correct. Anarchists are confident that in depth analysis of the Russian Revolution will confirm the limitations of Bolshevism as a revolutionary movement and point to libertarian ideas for anyone who wants to change the world.</p>
