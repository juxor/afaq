<H1><center>Appendix -- The Russian Revolution
</center></h1>
<p>
This appendix of the FAQ exists to discuss in depth the Russian
revolution and the impact that Leninist ideology and practice had
on its outcome. Given that the only reason why Leninism is taken
seriously in some parts of the revolutionary movement is the 
Russian Revolution, it is useful to expose what Alexander Berkman
called "the Bolshevik Myth." This means discussing certain aspects
of the revolution and indicating exactly how Leninism helped 
destroy any libertarian potential it had. It also means analysing
common, modern-day, Leninist excuses for the actions of the 
Bolsheviks to see if they hold water. It also means analysing in
depth specific events of the revolution (such as the Kronstadt
uprising of March 1921 and the libertarian influenced Makhnovist 
movement) to see if there was an alternative to Leninism at the
time. Luckily, the answer is yes.
<p>
As will become clear from this appendix, Bolshevik actions and 
ideology had a decisive impact on the development and degeneration
of the Revolution. With its centralised, top-down statist political
vision, its (openly) state capitalist economic vision and its aim
for party power, Leninism had pushed the revolution in an 
authoritarian direction before the Russian Civil War started (the
most common Leninist explanation of what went wrong). Leninism,
ironically enough, proved the anarchist critique of Marxism to be
correct. Anarchists are confident that in depth analysis of the
Russian Revolution will confirm the limitations of Bolshevism as
a revolutionary movement and point to libertarian ideas for anyone
who wants to change the world.
