<h1>What Anarchists Say about An Anarchist FAQ</h1>

<p>
<i>"At long last An Anarchist Frequently Asked Questions (AFAQ) 
has moved from the Internet onto the printed page . . . it is 
likely to be the primary source anarchists turn too for 
information about anarchist theory and history . . . . It is 
accessible, not laden with jargon but also built on ten years 
and more of solid research . . . The structure of the book is 
such that it is easy to dip into . . .  this [is a] comprehensive 
resource. The prefix to the book is '<u>An'</u> Anarchist FAQ. The 
collective is too modest. This is <u>the</u> place to go to find 
out about anarchist ides, theory and practice. It is accessible 
and based on sound research. Thoroughly recommended."</i>
(<a href="http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/freedom-review-of-an-anarchist-faq">Richard Griffin, <b>Freedom</b></a>).
</p>

<p>
<i>"the primary source of information about anarchism on the 
world wide web . . . a foundation stone for laying down the idea 
of anarchism as the viable alternative that we should work towards 
achieving."</i> (<i>"Workers Solidarity"</i>, <b>Workers Solidarity 
Movement</b>)
</p>

<p>
<i>"this invaluable resource is highly recommended for anyone 
wishing to delve further or gain a better understanding of anarchism 
as a practice, living, socially relevant ideology."</i> 
(<i>"Direct Action"</i>, <b>Solidarity Federation</b>)
</p>

<p>
<i>"The anarchist FAQ has been one of the standout achievements of 
the last decade in terms of its rigorous treatment of every aspect of 
the theory. Its translation from screen to print is long overdue."</i> 
(<b>Freedom</b>)
</p>

<p>
<i>"the most comprehensive resource available . . . for a discussion 
on anarchism is An Anarchist FAQ"</i> (Flint Jones, <b>NEFAC</b>)
</p>

<p>
<i>"The Anarchist FAQ collective are to be congratulated on producing 
this excellent book. Always intended to be used by anarchists as an 
organising tool, the FAQ will also be useful to newcomers to anarchism 
and to those who already think of themselves as anarchists, but who would 
like to deepen their understanding of anarchist politics. The FAQ format 
makes it really easy to dip into in order to find answers to all those 
questions that anarchists are often asked by sceptics and critics (of 
right and left) as well as by other activists who are sympathetic but 
just don't know much about anarchism, or have been influenced by the 
many misrepresentations of anarchism put about by Leninists and the 
capitalist media. So The Anarchist FAQ succeeds in being a very 
accessible introduction to anarchism, whilst being at the same time 
detailed, wide-ranging, properly researched and authoritative. Highly 
recommended!"</i> (David Berry author of <b>A History of the French 
Anarchist Movement, 1917-1945</b>)
</p>

<p>
<i>"Thanks for a fabulous job on this. What an amazing project! . . .  All 
best wishes to all of you, and again, congratulations on a excellent work."</i> 
(Mark Leier, author of <b>Bakunin: The Creative Passion</b>)
</p>

<p>
<i>"monumental and essential FAQ dedicated to anarchism"</i> 
(Norman Baillargeon, <b>L'order moins le pouvoir: Histoire et 
actualit&eacute; de l'anarchisme</b>)
</p>

<p>
<i>"The Anarchist FAQ should be one of the first stops for anyone 
studying anarchism.  It's an extensive compilation of material, 
painstakingly indexed, of anarchist history, theory and practice.  
Just tracing the tantalising block quotes to their original sources, 
via the amazing bibliography--which alone is worth the price of the 
book--will take you a long way toward an education on any of the 
subject headings.  On a personal note, I benefited greatly from 
stumbling across the FAQ near the beginning of my own journey 
into anarchism." </i> (Kevin Carson author of <b>Studies in 
Mutualist Political Economy</b>)
</p>

<p>
<i>""Found it very detailed and informative and I'm sure it will prove to be an
excellent reference book for those interested in the subject and for those
who wish to defend anarchism."</i> (John Couzin, anarchist from Glasgow)
