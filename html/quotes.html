<h1>What Anarchists Say about An Anarchist FAQ</h1>
<p>
<i>"At long last An Anarchist Frequently Asked Questions (AFAQ)<br>
has moved from the Internet onto the printed page . . . it is<br>
likely to be the primary source anarchists turn too for<br>
information about anarchist theory and history . . . . It is<br>
accessible, not laden with jargon but also built on ten years<br>
and more of solid research . . . The structure of the book is<br>
such that it is easy to dip into . . .  this [is a] comprehensive<br>
resource. The prefix to the book is '<u>An'</u> Anarchist FAQ. The<br>
collective is too modest. This is <u>the</u> place to go to find<br>
out about anarchist ides, theory and practice. It is accessible<br>
and based on sound research. Thoroughly recommended."</i><br>
(<a href="http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/freedom-review-of-an-anarchist-faq">Richard Griffin, <b>Freedom</b></a>).
</p>
<p>
<i>"the primary source of information about anarchism on the<br>
world wide web . . . a foundation stone for laying down the idea<br>
of anarchism as the viable alternative that we should work towards<br>
achieving."</i> (<i>"Workers Solidarity"</i>, <b>Workers Solidarity<br>
Movement</b>)
</p>
<p>
<i>"this invaluable resource is highly recommended for anyone<br>
wishing to delve further or gain a better understanding of anarchism<br>
as a practice, living, socially relevant ideology."</i><br>
(<i>"Direct Action"</i>, <b>Solidarity Federation</b>)
</p>
<p>
<i>"The anarchist FAQ has been one of the standout achievements of<br>
the last decade in terms of its rigorous treatment of every aspect of<br>
the theory. Its translation from screen to print is long overdue."</i><br>
(<b>Freedom</b>)
</p>
<p>
<i>"the most comprehensive resource available . . . for a discussion<br>
on anarchism is An Anarchist FAQ"</i> (Flint Jones, <b>NEFAC</b>)
</p>
<p>
<i>"The Anarchist FAQ collective are to be congratulated on producing<br>
this excellent book. Always intended to be used by anarchists as an<br>
organising tool, the FAQ will also be useful to newcomers to anarchism<br>
and to those who already think of themselves as anarchists, but who would<br>
like to deepen their understanding of anarchist politics. The FAQ format<br>
makes it really easy to dip into in order to find answers to all those<br>
questions that anarchists are often asked by sceptics and critics (of<br>
right and left) as well as by other activists who are sympathetic but<br>
just don't know much about anarchism, or have been influenced by the<br>
many misrepresentations of anarchism put about by Leninists and the<br>
capitalist media. So The Anarchist FAQ succeeds in being a very<br>
accessible introduction to anarchism, whilst being at the same time<br>
detailed, wide-ranging, properly researched and authoritative. Highly<br>
recommended!"</i> (David Berry author of <b>A History of the French<br>
Anarchist Movement, 1917-1945</b>)
</p>
<p>
<i>"Thanks for a fabulous job on this. What an amazing project! . . .  All<br>
best wishes to all of you, and again, congratulations on a excellent work."</i><br>
(Mark Leier, author of <b>Bakunin: The Creative Passion</b>)
</p>
<p>
<i>"monumental and essential FAQ dedicated to anarchism"</i><br>
(Norman Baillargeon, <b>L'order moins le pouvoir: Histoire et<br>
actualité de l'anarchisme</b>)
</p>
<p>
<i>"The Anarchist FAQ should be one of the first stops for anyone<br>
studying anarchism.  It's an extensive compilation of material,<br>
painstakingly indexed, of anarchist history, theory and practice.<br>
Just tracing the tantalising block quotes to their original sources,<br>
via the amazing bibliography--which alone is worth the price of the<br>
book--will take you a long way toward an education on any of the<br>
subject headings.  On a personal note, I benefited greatly from<br>
stumbling across the FAQ near the beginning of my own journey<br>
into anarchism." </i> (Kevin Carson author of <b>Studies in<br>
Mutualist Political Economy</b>)
</p>
<p>
<i>""Found it very detailed and informative and I'm sure it will prove to be an<br>
excellent reference book for those interested in the subject and for those<br>
who wish to defend anarchism."</i> (John Couzin, anarchist from Glasgow)
