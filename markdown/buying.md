Obviously, you can order [An Anarchist FAQ](http://www.anarchistfaq.org.uk)
(AFAQ) from any bookshop or any on-line bookseller. However, if you do then
the publisher (i.e., AK Press) gets less money back in return (middle-men get
their cut, in other words).

Normally, this is not an issue but as AK Press is an Anarchist publishing
house then this means that they will not get that money to fund new anarchist
material. Given its size and given that its price is £20/$25, every penny
counts!

So, please, if you are going to buy AFAQ then do so via AK Press and its
websites.

Please support anarchist publishers! At the very least, please order via a
radical bookshop rather than a capitalist company!

In terms of the UK, both [Freedom Bookshop](http://www.freedompress.org.uk/)
and [Housmans](http://www.housmans.com/) should now have copies. And it would,
of course, make an ideal book to be ordered from your local public library...

## Posting comments

 Like most sites we have a major problem with bots trying to post spam into
the comments section.  While looking for a better solution we are reduced to
only on turning on the ability to anonymously comment for brief periods around
the posting of new articles.  But if you are a regular visitor you can comment
at any time by [creating an
account](http://anarchism.pageabode.com/user/register) on the site and
[logging in](http://anarchism.pageabode.com/user/) before posting. But the
Spammers also set up accounts so to reduce the workload of deleting those we
only turn on the ability to create accounts for brief periods which we
announce on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/anarchistwriter) &amp; [Facebook
accounts](https://www.facebook.com/AnarchistWriters) so follow those to hear
when we have that turned on.  We do want you to be able to engage with us via
the comments and we are very sorry for the fact that we can't find a better
way of dealing with spam.
