# Appendix : Anarchism and "anarcho"-capitalism

This appendix exists for one reason, namely to explain why the idea of
"anarcho"-capitalism is a bogus one. While we have covered this topic in
[section F](secFcon.html), we thought that this appendix should be created in
order to discuss in more detail why anarchists reject both
"anarcho"-capitalism and its claims to being anarchist.

This appendix has three parts. The first two sections are our critique of
Bryan Caplan's "anarcho"-capitalist ["Anarchist Theory
FAQ."](http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/anarfaq.htm) Caplan's
FAQ is the main on-line attempt to give the oxymoron of "anarcho"-capitalism
some form of justification and so it is worthwhile explaining, using his FAQ
as the base, why such an attempt fails. The last part of this appendix is the
original version of [section F](secFcon.html),

As we will prove, Caplan's FAQ fails in its attempt to show that "anarcho"
capitalism can be considered as part of the anarchist movement and in fact his
account involves extensive re-writing of history. This appendix is in two
parts, a reply to Caplan's most recent FAQ release (version 5.2) and an older
reply to version 4.1.1 (which was originally section F.10 of the FAQ). The
[introduction](append12.html) to the reply to version 4.1.1 indicates what
most anarchists think of Caplan's FAQ and its claims of "objectivity" as so we
will not repeat ourselves here.

We decided to replace the original version of section F with an edited version
simply because the original section was too long in respect to the rest of the
FAQ. While this FAQ may have started out as a rebuttal to "anarcho"-capitalist
claims of being anarchist, it no longer is. As such, in an **_anarchist_** FAQ
section F became redundant as "anarcho"-capitalism is a fringe ideology even
within the USA. If it were not for their presence on the web and some
academics taking their claims to being anarchists at face value, we would only
mention them in passing.

We have decided to include this appendix as it is really an addition to the
main body of the FAQ. Parties interested in why "anarcho"-capitalist claims
are false can explore this appendix, those who are interested in anarchist
politics can read the FAQ without having to also read too many arguments
between anarchists and capitalists. We should, perhaps, thank Caplan for
allowing us an opportunity of explaining the ideas of such people as Proudhon
and Tucker, allowing us to quote them and so bring their ideas to a wider
audience and for indicating that anarchism, in all its forms, has always
opposed capitalism and always will.
