## An Anarchist FAQ Webpage Contacts

This web-site is the creation of many anarchists across the globe and  
is a classic example of the power of freedom, equality and mutual aid.

It is produced by a [small collective of people](intro.md)  
who work on the FAQ when we can (mostly in our free time, after work).  
This means that any e-mail sent may take a while to be replied to. We  
apologise for any delay, but we are not a corporate funded think-tank  
or full-time members of a party apparatus. We hope you understand.

If you want to contact some of those responsible, then send email to  
[anarchistfaq@yahoo.co.uk](mailto:anarchistfaq@yahoo.co.uk)
