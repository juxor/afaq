# Introduction

Here is a list of all the new additions to the FAQ. An list of older changes
can found [here](oldnew.md).

The version number of the FAQ changes as follows. A major change results in
then the version number is increased by one (from version 10.2 to version 11,
for example). If a minor change is being made then the current version is
increased by 0.1 (for example, from version 10.2 to 10.3).

As far as new anarchist and libertarian links are concerned, we will add them
when we get enough to make an update worthwhile. These updates have no effect
on the FAQ version number as we don't want to inflate it higher than the
content deserves.

We hope that this makes it clear to visitors!
