# Appendix : Anarchism and Marxism

This appendix exists to refute some of the many anti-anarchist diatribes
produced by Marxists. While we have covered why anarchists oppose Marxism in
[section H](secHcon.html), we thought it would be useful to reply to Marxist
webpages and books whose content is not explicitly covered in that section. In
this way we hope to indicate that Marxism is a flawed theory, flawed even to
the extent of not being able to present a honest critique of anarchism. This
consistent attempt to smear anarchism and distort its history and ideas is no
co-incidence -- rather it is required in order to present Marxism as the only
viable form of socialism and, more importantly, to hide the fact that much of
the populist Marxist rhetoric was, in fact, said by anarchists first and
latter stolen by Marxists to hide the authoritarian basis of their politics.

One last point. We are aware that we repeat many of our arguments in these
appendices. That, unfortunately, is avoidable for two reasons. Firstly,
Marxists usually repeat the same false assertions against anarchism and so we
have to answer them each time they appear. Marxists seem to subscribe to the
point of view that repeating an error often enough makes it true. Secondly, we
have tried to make each appendix as self-contained as possible and that meant
repeating certain material and arguments to achieve this. We hope the reader
understands.
