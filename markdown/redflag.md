As discussed in [An Anarchist FAQ](http://www.anarchistfaq.org.uk)'s appendix
on [Symbols of Anarchy](append2.html), anarchists at first used the **Red**
Flag as their symbol of choice, with the [Black Flag](append2.html#black)
slowly replacing it over a period of many decades. Both flags, however, had
their roots in working class struggle and protest, both were anti-capitalist
symbols raised by working class people in revolt against exploitation and
oppression.

Given that the Black Flag became the preferred anarchist symbol in the 20th
century, it comes as no surprise to see that both Proudhon and Bakunin praised
the use of the red flag. Bakunin, for example, wrote of _"the flag of
theoretical materialism, the red flag of economic equality and social justice,
is raised by the practical idealism of the oppressed and famishing masses,
tending to realise the greatest liberty and the human right of each in the
fraternity of all men on the earth."_ [**God and the State**, p. 47] Proudhon
a few weeks after building barricades in Paris, as historian Jack Hayward
notes, _"predicted in March 1848 the internationalism of the Red Flag"_ when
he wrote: _"Keep if you wish the **tricolore**, symbol of our nationality. But
remember that the red flag represents the final revolution . . . The red flag
is the federal standard of humanity!"_ [quoted by Hayward, **After the French
Revolution**, p. 246]

Originally, as Hayward reports, the Red Flag was flown from the Paris town
hall to signal the proclamation of martial law to deal with food riots in 1789
and in July 1791 it was used at the massacre of anti-royalist demonstrators.
In 1792, the republican revolutionaries turned it into a symbol of defiance by
inscribing on red flags: _**'Martial law of the sovereign people against the
rebellion of the executive power'**"_ [**Op. Cit.**, p. 245] After that, use
of the Red Flag declined:

> _"the Red Flag went into eclipse. The **tricolore** carried all before it
for the rest of the Revolution and under Napoleon, being readopted at the 1830
Revolution as the emblem of the July Monarchy. The Left sought an alternative
and at first it was the Black Flag symbolising a fight to the death that
appeared in the 1831 Lyons riots, with its slogan: **'Work or Death.'**"_
[**Op. Cit.**, p. 245]

So the Black Flag was a recognised symbol of the Left, so it was unsurprising
that when the Red Flag became too associated with Marxist social democracy in
France, the likes of Louise Michel urged anarchists to raise the Black Flag.

Why did the Red Flag become the symbol of choice for the socialist movement,
Proudhon and Bakunin included? For this, we need to look at the 1848
Revolution in France and, in particular, the activities of that perennial
state-communist revolutionary, Louis Auguste Blanqui. It was in February 1848
that the Red Flag _"appeared during the insurrection for the first time as a
workers' banner on a large scale, alongside the **tricolore.** It symbolised
their wish for break with the Orleanist past."_ Blanqui's first symbolic act
of that revolt was to issue a manifesto _"deploring the decision to retain the
**tricolore** as the national flag instead of replacing it with the Red
Flag."_ The 25th of February saw a demonstration of armed citizens carrying
red flags. [Hayward, **Op. Cit.**, p. 245]

As with the use of the Black Flag by anarchists, the use of the Red Flag by
socialists of all tendencies spread from France. In Britain, the Red Flag was
adopted as a Chartist symbol on 31st of December, 1849. On 10th November 1850
European Socialists in exile in London adopted it in place of their national
flags, _"a prelude to it becoming the emblem of the First International in
1866."_ [**Op. Cit.**, p. 246] Its adoption by the **International Workers
Association** should come as no surprise given the key role the French
followers of Proudhon played in setting it up. [George Woodcock,
**Anarchism**, pp. 198-9]

It comes, therefore, as no surprise that the newspapers of the time denounced
_"the Red Flag of anarchy"_, given that anarchists (like others in the
revolutionary workers movement) raised it in their struggles and revolts. Both
Proudhon and Bakunin associated themselves with that symbol, just as they both
proclaimed themselves socialists. However, after their deaths state socialism
came to dominate most labour movements in the world and the Red Flag became
associated with Marxian social democracy and anarchists sought other symbols.
With [Communard](secA5.html#seca51) and indefatigable revolutionary [Louise
Michel](http://anarchism.pageabode.com/anarcho/Louise-Michel) taking the
initiative, that other flag of French working class revolt, the Black Flag,
was taken up as a replacement. Use of the Black Flag continues to this day...

## Posting comments

 Like most sites we have a major problem with bots trying to post spam into
the comments section.  While looking for a better solution we are reduced to
only on turning on the ability to anonymously comment for brief periods around
the posting of new articles.  But if you are a regular visitor you can comment
at any time by [creating an
account](http://anarchism.pageabode.com/user/register) on the site and
[logging in](http://anarchism.pageabode.com/user/) before posting. But the
Spammers also set up accounts so to reduce the workload of deleting those we
only turn on the ability to create accounts for brief periods which we
announce on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/anarchistwriter) &amp; [Facebook
accounts](https://www.facebook.com/AnarchistWriters) so follow those to hear
when we have that turned on.  We do want you to be able to engage with us via
the comments and we are very sorry for the fact that we can't find a better
way of dealing with spam.
