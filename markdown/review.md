## The Big Black Book

At long last _An Anarchist Frequently Asked Questions_ (AFAQ) has moved from
the Internet onto the printed page - 555 printed pages to be precise. In an
engaging introduction regular **Freedom** contributor Iain McKay sets out the
aims of AFAQ. The purpose of the book, he writes, is to present the case for
anarchism, '_to convince people they should become anarchists' _and to act as
a resource for anarchists. All these are laudable but I suspect the main use
the book will be put too is as a resource for people who already regard
themselves as anarchists.  Indeed it is likely to be _the_ primary source
anarchists turn too for information about anarchist theory and history. Want
to know about the role of anarchists in the May-June revolt in France, 1968?
Interested in the origins of the black, black/red flag and circled A as
symbols of our movement? Want arguments for why capitalism does not benefit
working class people? Need to remind yourself of the purpose of the state?
This is the place to turn.

The book would also be excellent for the (small but) growing number of
university courses which include anarchism as part of their programme.
Interestingly while there are many good anarchists working as academics in
universities and colleges this book has been produced by activists writing and
researching in their spare time and contributing collectively. An example of
anarchism in action in fact. As the book points out this is _'an anarchist FAQ
written by anarchists'. _It is accessible, not laden with jargon but also
built on ten years and more of solid research.

Take, for example, the answer to the question: is profit the reward for the
productivity of capital (page 236)? The four-page essay that follows includes
referenced quotes from Prodhon, Bakunin, David Ellerman, the economist Joan
Robinson, William Lazonick, and early English socialist Thomas Hodgskin. The
answer to the question, in a nutshell, is "_the reason why capital gets a
"reward" is simply due to the current system which gives the capitalist class
an advantage which allows them to refuse access to their property except under
the condition that they command the workers to make more than they have to pay
in wages and keep their capital at the end of production process to be used
afresh the next_". While I suspect that most readers of Freedom would have
given a similar answer having a resource that we can turn too to provide
quotes from other anarchists and critics of capitalism as well as reminding
ourselves (or finding for the first time) anarchist arguments is invaluable.

The book, the first of two volumes, is organised around the following main
questions: **What is Anarchism?;** **Why do anarchists oppose the current
system?**; **What are the myths of capitalist economics?**; **How does statism
and capitalism affect society?**; **What do anarchists think cause ecological
problems?**; and **Is 'anarcho'-capitalism a type of anarchism?** Each section
is broken down into a series of sub-questions addressing specific elements of
the main theme. The structure of the book is such that it is easy to dip into.

If there is a single underlying theme to the book it is one born from the
original web-based AFAQ project, that is the only political theory that can
legitimately be called 'anarchism' is a comprehensively left wing ideology
rooted in class politics. All other claims to anarchism and libertarianism are
at best partial and at worse as in the case of so-called 'anarcho'-capitalism
retrograde. Anarchism is a left project or it is nothing.

The book also provides valuable arguments against those on the authoritarian
left like Lenin who described anarchism once as 'an infantile disorder'.

While addressing the big questions that anarchism as a credible political
theory needs to answer as well as responding to the criticisms levelled at
anarchism from both the left and right, the book also includes an interesting
[Appendix on the Symbols of Anarchy](../../../../../../append2.html)
describing the history of the black flag including its use by Nestor Makhno's
partisans in the Russian Revolution when they managed to keep Ukraine free of
authoritarian rule for two years. The use of the black flag by libertarians,
however, dates much further back than that. AFAQs points out that "_Louise
Michel, famous participant in the Paris Commune of 1871, was instrumental in
popularising the use of the black flag in anarchist circles"._ Unlike the
black flag the history of the circled A symbol is less clear. While some like
Peter Marshall claims that it originates from Proudhon's maxim that _'Anarchy
in Order'_, this as the book points out is unlikely. The first 'official'
appearances of the symbol seem to have been in 1956 when at its foundation in
Brussels the **Alliance Ouvrier Anarchiste** adopted the symbol and images of
anarchist militia in the Spanish Civil War with the image painted on their
helmets. While the exact origins of the symbol are unknown the fact that in
most languages the word for anarchism begins with an 'A', along with the
simplicity of the image perhaps explains its universal appeal (and not just to
anarchists).

A couple of minor criticisms. Inevitably the size of the book means that at
Â£20 it will be out of the reach of some comrades - however the Anarchist FAQ
website remains a free resource. An index and bibliography would have been
valuable. However these are only small points. Iain and the rest of the
collective and AK Press should be congratulated for producing this
comprehensive resource. The prefix to the book is _'An'_ Anarchist FAQ. The
collective is too modest. This is _the_ place to go to find out about
anarchist ides, theory and practice. It is accessible and based on sound
research. Thoroughly recommended.

## Posting comments

 Like most sites we have a major problem with bots trying to post spam into
the comments section.  While looking for a better solution we are reduced to
only on turning on the ability to anonymously comment for brief periods around
the posting of new articles.  But if you are a regular visitor you can comment
at any time by [creating an
account](http://anarchism.pageabode.com/user/register) on the site and
[logging in](http://anarchism.pageabode.com/user/) before posting. But the
Spammers also set up accounts so to reduce the workload of deleting those we
only turn on the ability to create accounts for brief periods which we
announce on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/anarchistwriter) &amp; [Facebook
accounts](https://www.facebook.com/AnarchistWriters) so follow those to hear
when we have that turned on.  We do want you to be able to engage with us via
the comments and we are very sorry for the fact that we can't find a better
way of dealing with spam.
