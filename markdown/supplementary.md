# Supplementary Material

These appendices contain material which build upon the main text but which are
not essential to it. Some reflect the origins of _An Anarchist FAQ_ as a
rebuttal of claims that “anarcho”-capitalism is a form of anarchism ([section
F](secFcon.md)). Others, material which was originally to be included in
[section H](secHcon.md) but which space precluded or replies to Marxist
articles on anarchism. The latter aimed to refute articles as they appeared,
but there is only so many times the same nonsense can be addressed.
