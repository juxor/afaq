# Appendix -- The Russian Revolution

This appendix of the FAQ exists to discuss in depth the Russian revolution and
the impact that Leninist ideology and practice had on its outcome. Given that
the only reason why Leninism is taken seriously in some parts of the
revolutionary movement is the Russian Revolution, it is useful to expose what
Alexander Berkman called "the Bolshevik Myth." This means discussing certain
aspects of the revolution and indicating exactly how Leninism helped destroy
any libertarian potential it had. It also means analysing common, modern-day,
Leninist excuses for the actions of the Bolsheviks to see if they hold water.
It also means analysing in depth specific events of the revolution (such as
the Kronstadt uprising of March 1921 and the libertarian influenced Makhnovist
movement) to see if there was an alternative to Leninism at the time. Luckily,
the answer is yes.

As will become clear from this appendix, Bolshevik actions and ideology had a
decisive impact on the development and degeneration of the Revolution. With
its centralised, top-down statist political vision, its (openly) state
capitalist economic vision and its aim for party power, Leninism had pushed
the revolution in an authoritarian direction before the Russian Civil War
started (the most common Leninist explanation of what went wrong). Leninism,
ironically enough, proved the anarchist critique of Marxism to be correct.
Anarchists are confident that in depth analysis of the Russian Revolution will
confirm the limitations of Bolshevism as a revolutionary movement and point to
libertarian ideas for anyone who wants to change the world.
